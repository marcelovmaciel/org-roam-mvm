* Sonke questions
Those are questions that aim to connect the notes with other notes and with
projects.

- What is it about ?
- What does it mean for ... ?
- How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what I already know?
- How does this fact fit into my idea of …?
- How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory?
- Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other?
- Isn’t this argument similar to that one?
- Haven’t I heard this before?

- What questions are triggered by these new ideas?


* How can I combine ideas to generate something new?
By reading this I believe I should have a more clear idea of where each tasks falls. What is the *context?* of any task I do AND what if study/work what is the project?

* notes
The gtd method works in 5 steps:
1. Collect
2. Process
3. Organize
4. Review
5. Do


** Collect
In the *collect* step I collect any task related thing (ideas should come here
but I'll leave them to the fleeting inbox).
** Process
In the *process* step I turn those tasks, references and so on into two groups:
- Does not demand action
  - *Discard* those you know you won't actually do; 
  - Put into a different list those that do not have a definite date -
    *"projects"*
  - Put into *references* those things you want to take a look in the future.
- Demands action
  - If something is quick put it on the top of the agenda and start with it;
  - If it is not quick (5,10min) put it in the agenda (with date);
  - If it is too big turn into a *Project*
    - Projects are headlines of a *series of concrete tasks* related to it.

** Organize
Put those tasks into their *context*. In my case, give them tags (work,
personal, routine, appointments and so on). Give them priorities!

** Review
Review daily or weekly your tasks

The gtd method works in 5 steps:
1. Collect
   - An *inbox* of any task related thing
2. Process
   Either:
   - Discard
   - (got into [[file:~/Drive/Org/Projects/20200711093120-my_projects_amorphous_todos.org][amorphous projects list]] or into ([[file:~/Drive/Org/Projects/refs-dump.org][refs dump]] or [[file:~/Drive/Org/Projects/20200702062139-techniques_refs.org][tech refs (more specific and organized)]])
   - agenda
3. Organize
   Put tasks into context: tags (and which project). Put priorities.
4. Review
   Rethink tasks and priorities.
