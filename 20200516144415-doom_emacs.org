* Introduction

As a way of using [[github:org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] , I have moved to [[github:hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]]. This is a
pre-configuration of [[https:www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] centered around the evil-mode, which is a vim
keybindings emulation package.



Doom emacs has the notion of *workspaces* which one can access through ~SPC TAB~. It is very useful to name workspaces, more on that below.

Similar to spacemacs there are *projects* which are simply projectile projects.

* Commands

- ~SPC :~ for ~M-x~.

** Workspace management

- There is a *project* family of commands ~SPC p _~
  - ~SPC p p~ switches projects
- The *workspace* family of commands ~SPC TAB~ is really useful:
  - ~SPC TAB .~ for switching
  - ~SPC TAB n~ creates a new workspace
  - ~SPC TAB r~ renames the workspace
  - ~SPC TAB s~ saves it to disk 
  - ~SPC TAB l~ loads pre-saved workspaces
- *Magit* can be called with ~SPC gg~

** Buffer switching
- ~SPC b B~  to switch to a buffer outside the current project.
- ~SPC SPC~ to switch to a file within the current project, with fuzzy completion
- ~SPC ,~ to switch to a buffer within the current project, again with fuzzy completion.
- ~SPC fr~ to load a recently viewed file.

** Window moving
- The ~SPC w _~ family. This is useful to go beyond the annoying ~C-x o~
- Use ~SPC w c~ to close the current window
** Text searching
- ~SPC sp~ + query string,  to search all files in the current project.
- ~/~ + query to search within the current buffer. Use ~n~ and ~N~ to go to next and previous matches.
- ~gs SPC~ + query to search with jump to options

** Source code navigation
- THIS IS REALLY COOL
- ~gd~ goes to symbol definition at point
- ~gD~ list the references to the symbol at point
- ~K~ for documentation to symbol at point.
