#+TITLE: My Weltanschauung
- tags :: [[file:20200520213408-my_project_ideas.org][My Project Ideas]]

* Introduction

  This notes tries to delineate my general worldview. A worldview might not be
  needed either for doing science (see cite:codato2011marxismo) or for being a
  political being. Nevertheless, I believe it is a good way of coming up with
  neat ideas and for organizing my thoughts.

  What worldviews do I consider interesting?

* Socialism / Marxism / Critical Theory

The socialist and Marxist worldview is the foundation of my
intellectual journey.

Socialism I'll separate from Marxism, and relate it to egalitarianism,
exploitation, domination and expropriation. The main way of articulating
socialist views is through Marxism and Critical Theory. This connects with plain
social science, but also with other structural views such as gender and race -
which I'm not as conversational as with class.

** Marxism

Lukacs may be the greatest articulation of marxism as a Weltanschauung. He goes
as far as saying it is some kind of social ontology. Maybe any social theory
assumes some kind of ontology, but Lukacs brings it to the forefront.

Marxism connects with individualist theories through the analytical marxists literature.

** Critical Theory

I see critical theory as an offspring of marxism.

Both jaeggi and habermas works connect to liberal political theory.


* Liberal / Decision Theoretic / Individualist

This is the second cluster of ideas that I consider a different world-view.

I consider it to have three dimensions: the normative (liberal), the formal
(decision theoretic) and the epistemological (individualist). Obviously it has got an
ontological dimension, but I have never given it much thought. Maybe I've got to
take a look at the social ontology literature that has appeared in the past
years.


** Liberal
John stuart mill, dewey, berlin, spitz, rawls, habermas and ostrom are the big
names of my liberal inheritance.

- [[https://newleftreview.org/issues/II123/articles/lorna-finlayson-rules-of-the-game][Lorna Finlayson, Rules of The Game?, NLR 123, May–June 2020]]
** Decision Theoretic

The decision theoretic setting is highly general. It is my favorite way of
theorizing and it neatly connects with both institutional and evolutionary
theories of social behavior.

The problem is that it is too indeterminate (more on that below). It cannot
stand on its own as a theory of society as it is almost meaningless without some
enrichment of some sort. Institutions, networks, discourses, evolution and
class/race/gender are ways of doing so.

The decision theoretic foundation, however, allows us to do all that in careful
way. Consequently, it shouldn't be thrown away.

** Individualist
The methodological individualist way of theorizing is the preferred of the
mainstream of political science, economics and analytical sociology. Though it
is important it is too inderterminate (see binmore on elster and elster
articles). Understanding its limitations is paramount, particularly because a
great deal of good work uses it.

* Modeling / Sociotechnical / Algorithms / Evolution

This final cluster is my twist on the analytical and formal individualist
approach. Also it helps focusing on nuts and bolts. 

Modeling is about methodology, algorithms about tecnhiques,
sociotechnical systems as target systems and evolution as a privileged
algorithm.

** [#C] Modeling
*** [#C] Epistemology of modeling
- On pluralism and limits of the analytical status quo:

- cite:appiah2017if


** [#A] Algorithms

I'm particularly interested in algorithmic thinking as a way of doing science
AND as a social phenomena AND society as mediated by algorithms. For algs as
social phenomena it is better to see the sociotechnical systems section.

*** Algorithmic institutionalism

I have with Kaique this project of proposing a thoroughly algorithmic approach
to social behavior. Plots equation can be turned into the composition of
procedures. See the github repo for that.

** [#A] Sociotechnical systems

The sociothenical systems approach involves analyzing the interactions between
humans and tech and humans through tech.

Maybe my big research agenda is exactly *collective decision making in sociotechnical systems*.

**** Fairness in ml

I already have a project idea on that: [[file:20200616033314-fairness_in_ml_through_social_choice.org][Fairness in Ml through social choice]] . The thing is, there are great papers that discuss exactly the limitations of an abstract approach such as social choice. One of them is cite:selbst2019fairness . How can I fuse an approach careful about structure and power while also being attentive to values conflicts?

- [[https://github.com/google/ml-fairness-gym][GitHub - google/ml-fairness-gym]] - this is an interesting connection with my work on social simulation !!!!


**** Critical digital humanities/ai studies

**** Sources of inspiration

The works from the laboratory from dedeo and dodds are one my main
inspirations here:

- [[http://simondedeo.com/][Axiom of Chance – thoughts from the Laboratory for Social Minds at Carnegie M...]]
  - Dedeo has courses on [[https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/67-introduction-to-renormalization/segments/5411?summary][Complexity Explorer]] and many tutorials
- [[http://www.uvm.edu/storylab/][The PoCS: Principles of Complex Systems]]
  -  Dodds also has lots of materials in his site [[https://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/][Peter Sheridan Dodds]].

Moretti is also a huge source of inspiration (as he interleaves nlp with
evolutionary thinking):

 Roth also has some good papers.
** [#C] Evolution
This involves using the evolutionary algorithm as a tool. Seems simple, but lots
can be achieved by doing so.
