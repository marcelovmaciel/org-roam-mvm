* Struct questions

** What is the goal/ general argument of the text?
Discuss what theory of trust is better supported by data, using a structural equation

** What are the specific arguments of the text?

- Cultural theories of democracy:
  - Civic culture $\rightarrow$ Make democracy work
  - Relatedly Trust $\rightarrow$ Support  $\rightarrow$ Make democracy work
  - Def:
    #+begin_quote
We use the term cultural theories to refer to a variety of loosely related
constructs that seek to explain political institutions and behavior in terms of
the shared customs, values, and beliefs of a social group.
    #+end_quote
- Institutional theories of democracy would be most prominent alternative to civic culture theories. In those theories logic is : regime performance $\rightarrow$ political support
- The same can be said about institutions: if they perform well then they receive support
- Both kinds of theories ASSUME that trust matters, he says.
- They find that economic performance matters more than institutional and interpersonal trust:
  #+begin_quote
The results show that the consequences of institutional and interper- sonal
trust in Russia are considerably more limited than cultural theories pre-
suppose. Institutional hypotheses about the importance of political and eco-
nomic performance receive much greater support. Nevertheless, the effects,
especially of institutional trust, are sufficient to suggest that cultural
theories cannot be dismissed altogether and need to be integrated with
institutional theories in a synthetic model.
  #+end_quote

- Their argument is that trust in political institutions may contribute to support for democratic ideals, but does not explain much support for the current regime nor for undemocratic alternatives

- It is not only about ECONOMIC performance, but also about political PERFORMANCE. So, it is not about trusting the "political institutions", but, rather, assessing if they are performing well
  - So, in their view performance matters more, and actually explains, trust and support.
- Heretofore, their literature review
  - Why trust matters?
    1. It generates, or sometimes is deemed equal, diffuse support
    2. Facilitates the acceptance of democratic ideals and rejection of undemocratic alternatives
       #+begin_quote
       Second, cultural theories hypothesize that trust facilitates the publicâ€™s acceptance of democratic values and ideals (Norris, 1999) and its rejection of undemocratic alternatives (Muller, Jukam, & Seligson, 1982; Rose, Mishler, & Haerpfer, 1998).
       #+end_quote
    3. Trust promotes political involvement
    4. There is also the interpersonal trust literature (Uslaner, 2002 is a summary, but Wilson also works within this tradition). It argues that interpersonal trust indirectly leads to trust in institutions and, hence, to political support.
- Hierarchy (or radius) of trust:
  1. family and friends
  2. impersonal trust
  3. trust on political institutions

- The relationship between those spheres is contentious: unidirectional, reciprocal or none:?
- Institutional theories see trust as a response to institutional performance

- Therefore, trust is not something deeply embedded. For institutional theories both trust and support are caused by performance, and trust is, at most, a control variable (as it might, through democratic ideals and more involvement and so on, indirectly impact support).
** What are the main concepts of the text?
- Trust vs performance vs support
