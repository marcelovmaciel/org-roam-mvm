  It is a kind of [[file:20200529164706-what_is_a_monotonic_voting_procedure.org][monotonicity]] failure (or paradox). In this case is when more
  voting showing up, supporting, an alternative not necessarily is better for
  the alternative. Actually, cite:Moulin_1988 shows that all [[file:20200529154006-when_a_voting_method_is_condorcet_consistent.org][condorcet
  consistent]] methods are amenable to the no show paradox.
