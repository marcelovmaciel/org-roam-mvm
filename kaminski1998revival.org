- Literature as usual tends to focus on (macro)economic and social variables
  #+begin_quote
[...] Focused mainly on the economic and social costs of tran-
sition. These costs were believed responsible for the widespread disillusion-
ment with democracy and the increase in the support of the former commu-
nists. T
  #+end_quote

- That is the whole point of their argument. While people focus on social and
  economics structures that would explain the shift in preference and hence the
  shift in political power, they show that all that is conditional upon
  institutions
- Small shift in preferences, but huge electoral victory for the post-communists left
- If the electoral system was different or if the right had an unified
  coalition, the scenario would have been another one.
  #+begin_quote
It turns out that the
most powerful effect was that of a new electoral formula. The second most
powerful factor that contributed to the victory of the Left was the failure of the
fragmented post-Solidarity Right to form a coalition.
  #+end_quote
- The shift in voter distributions, the entrance of two new parties, are shown
  to have little impact !
  #+begin_quote
Only the conjunction of the change in the electoral law, the coalitional failure
of the Right, and the increased electoral support for the post-communists
could have produced a post-communist controlled cabinet
  #+end_quote
- The main two determining factors to coalesce are *votes and seats*
- So there are two games: the vote-game and the seat-game
  - The electoral law is a function that assigns to any vote game \(G^V\) the corresponding seat-game \(G^S = EL(G^V)\)
- Why would two parties coalesce? The the sum of the seats for the coalition is greater than the sum of the seats secured individually
  #+begin_quote
Two (or more) parties coalesce if they expect the number of seats for the
coalition to be greater than the sum of seats they can secure individually
  #+end_quote
- The polls with the plethora of problems typical of the epoch/place had an impact on the failure of coalitional negotiations
- With the evolution of the polls the right went from a coalitional game to a prisoner's dilemma
- His data strategy is highly relevant for my own ideas:
  #+begin_quote
All simulations use actual district-level election results, data from the CBOS
surveys, and data from a special survey that was designed by the authors to
reconstruct second preferences of voters (i.e., candidates/parties they would
have voted for had their first choice been not available).
  #+end_quote
- He assumes away the idea of behavioral adaptation to the electoral law:
  #+begin_quote
This assumption simply means that the changes in the electoral law do not induce
voters to vote strategically. We comment on the robustness of this assumption
and discuss possible adjustments.
  #+end_quote

- They find a minimal effect of the typical argument: entrance of two new rightist parties (which would had had taken votes from the main right party)
- This is a great way of defending both coalitional game theory and fair division
  #+begin_quote
The first issue to be resolved by members of a prospective coalition is, what
information should be taken into account to represent the power of the members?
[...] The second issue is to settle on a fair solution problem of dividing seats
among coalitional partners. [...] Finally, the last problem is that of
implementation. How should the solution be implemented given the constraints of
limited transferability of seats and uncertain results of the elections?
  #+end_quote

- His analisys is a purely political one. Beauty!
  #+begin_quote
Electoral laws, coalitional structures, existing survey
methodologies, or the timing of elections may strongly influence the results
  #+end_quote
** What are the main concepts of the text?
- partition function
- coalesce
-

* Insights
- The PT power as seen in polls prior the election foreclosed the formation of
  an alliance, even though it was Condorcet dominated. This can got into the
  analysis of [[file:20200711104510-bolsonaro_and_condorcet_consystency.org][Bolsonaro and condorcet consystency]]
