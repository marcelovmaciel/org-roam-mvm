* Why am I reading this/ Where this might be useful/Which project or idea that I already have will benefit from this and how?
To write a paper with Grofman. Hopefully I'll never touch an OD paper
afterwards. The closest idea that relates to that is [[file:20210308092711-dynamic_issue_salience_abm.org][Dynamic issue salience abm]]. Obviously, there is a connection with my own paper on od: cite:maciel20_ideol_motiv_biases_multip_issues_opinion_model



* Struct questions

** What is the goal/ general argument of the text?
To present a model of consensual dynamics.

- Notice that he mentions two versions of the model:
  - Probability distribution
  - Point estimate of a parameter
- Agents: \(i = 1, \ldots , k\)
- \(F_i\) subjective probability distribution for some \(\theta \in A \subseteq \Omega\) s.t. \(\OMEGA\) is the parameter space
- If \(\sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1\) then  \(\sum_{i=1}^k p_i F_i(A)\)  is the probability distribution of any measurable set \(A\), also known as the overall opinion of the group, or as the *opinion pool*
- What is the posterior opinion of \(i\) after interacting with \(j = 1\) ?
  \(F_{i1} =\sum_{j=1}^k p_{ij} F_i(A)  \)
- \(\mathb{P}_{k,k} = p_{i j}(i=1, \cdots, k ; j=1, \cdots, k) \), notice it is a stochastic matrix, also:
  \(F^{\prime}=\left(F_{1}, \cdots, F_{k}\right) \)  and \( \mathbf{F}^{(1) \prime}=\left(F_{11}, \cdots, F_{k 1}\right)\)
  then \(\mathbf{F^{(1)} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{F}\)
- If everybody is connected, and everybody sees others have revised their opinions, them they ought to review the opinions again! So:
 \(F_{i 2}=\sum_{j=1}^{k} p_{i j} F_{j 1}\)
- Notice that if we generalize that well get:
  - \(\mathbf{F^{(n)} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{F}^{(n-1)}\)
  - And the process stops when we get:
    \(\mathbf{F^{(n+1)} \approxeq \mathbf{F}^{n}\)
- Since it is a stochastic matrix  it can be regarded as a one-step transition probability of a Markov Chain.
- Results using markov chain:
  - If the states of the chain form *at least* two disjoint closed sets of communicating states
  - or
  - if the communicating states in a single closed set are periodic
  - then
  - a consensus is not reached
- The examples are paramount!!!
- One interesting thing is that the changing weights is taken into account. I have not thought about this much, gotta see my own paper:
