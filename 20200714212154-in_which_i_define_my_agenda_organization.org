 So, a todo should have the following elements:

- A *name* (if it is a task it should be actionable)
- A *status* (TODO(t) STARTED(s) WAITING(w) APPT(a) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c) DEFERRED(f))
- *Tags* (what is the category, the context)
- The *priority level* (High, medium, low)

So, what are the contexts?

- Personal
  - appointments
- Studies
  - reading
  - questions (it will be in a dump)
- Work
  - projects
  - ideas

 So, what are the kinds of todos that I have?
- Concrete actionable tasks
- Appointments (which is a status)
- daily, routine, habit
- Projects (umbrella for writing code, researching an idea, writing a paper, writing other things)
