  This project was inspired by cite:nurmi2019most argument that we must
  understand better the behavior of restricted domains so that we can advise
  people on which voting method to use at which environment. This is a general
  argument obviously, in this specific idea I'm interested in domain
  restrictions. I believe that there is some relationship between "shape" and
  domain restriction and the tools of cohomology in the line developed by the
  topological data analysis community and cite:torres2020representations.
