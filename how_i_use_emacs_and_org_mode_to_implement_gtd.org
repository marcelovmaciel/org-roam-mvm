- He uses two kinds of tags:
  - *Category tags* are  related to the type of thing (tasks,projects, financial)
    - defined with
       #+BEGIN_SRC
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CATEGORY: Projects
  :END:
       #+END_SRC
below the section 
       
  - *Context tags* are used to define where a task can be done ( #+TAGS: { OFFICE(o) HOME(h) } COMPUTER(c) PROJECT(p) READING(r) )
  - He has a good notion of *project*
    #+begin_quote
A project is a group of activities with a specific outcome that requires more than one action step and usually has a target date for completion.

Each project is stored as as heading with a subheading to contain a description of the project, and a work breakdown structure.


    #+end_quote

- Another important thing is an agenda is the *status*. In this case the todo
  states. The ones he uses are great
  #+BEGIN_SRC
 #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) WAITING(w) APPT(a) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c) DEFERRED(f)

where

TODO
    The item is ready to be done at the earliest opportunity or at the date (and maybe time) indicated in the SCHEDULED tag. Some tasks are given a DEADLINE date which is useful for scheduling the tasks during my daily planning.
STARTED
    I should use this tag when I start on a task, but if I clock in to a TODO item, I don't really need this task.
WAITING
    I did some work on this task but I am waiting for a response. If I use this task I schedule the task into the future as a reminder to follow up with some notes in the body of the task.
APPT
    Used to tag an activity that can only be done at the specified time and date, instead of tasks that can be completed at any time.
DONE
    The task is completed.
CANCELLED
    I decided not to do this task but have left the task on file with this status.
DEFERRED
    Used to identify a task that will not be activated just yet. The reason will be included in the task notes

  #+END_SRC
