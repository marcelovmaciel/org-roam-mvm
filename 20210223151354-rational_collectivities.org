  One interesting thing about the criticism of Bartels of RCT is that indeed in
  some pre-defined cartesian product of Agents x Alternatives we may not be able
  to rationalize the agents preferences, say due to incompleteness (partial
  ranking). Hence, this leads us to the more interesting question: How can we
  treat a collectivity that may be constituted of a mix of agents lacking in
  some of the assumptions of rational choice, but that, in the aggregate, we
  might be able to characterize the collective as rational and in the end as a
  *voting bloc*? Talking with Kaique I deduce two approaches: a probabilistic
  one, and an algebraic one (algebraic decomposition).

 So, it seems this is a problem of finding *representative voters*. For that,
  see [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00355-015-0906-3][Preference exclusions for social rationality | SpringerLink]] as an entry
  point to the literature as well as Duggan's unpublished manuscript "Value
  Restriction, Median Voters, and the Core" and "Non-cooperative Games Among
  Groups"
