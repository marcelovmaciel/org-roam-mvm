#+title: Democracy and insatisfaction: WGS and social choice
- tags :: [[file:20200714190158-stochastic_democratic_advantage.org][Stochastic democratic advantage]]
WGS has a theory that democracy is the only regime which institutionalizes the insatisfaction of the citizens, since it cannot possibly fulfill everybody's wishes. To model that is my purpose. *Different voting mechanisms imply different models of satisfaction*. This connects directly with the rule by multiple majorities theory of cite:christiano19_rule_by_multip_major.
