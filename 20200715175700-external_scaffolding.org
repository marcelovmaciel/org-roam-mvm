I already have the theory that the value  of formalization lies not in rigour but in tweaking, tinkering and delegating to an external system.

The thing is cite:ahrens2017take argues the same. He defends the role of writing in helping developing ideas and making our ideas clearer, but the same could be said about formal models.

He also connects with my argument about sharing, which he frames as related to publicization of our thoughts.


The next step is to relate this with plotting and diagrams.
