Functionalities I've discovered so far: 
- Add new bib entry from title query string
- Add new bib entry from doi or url string
- Download pdf from query string
- Move file to pdfs dir
- Open file of bib entry
- insert cite bib entry inside org file
- extract cited entries into a new .bib file https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/41821/creating-bib-file-containing-only-the-cited-references-of-a-bigger-bib-file/41823#41823

- ~orb-note-actions~ is useful if the note was created using org-roam-bibtex, or simply has a roam-key

- A simple insertion of cite is done through  ~org-ref-insert-link~!

- If one calls ~helm-bibtex~ a bib reference management menu is opened!

- ~biblio-lookup~ is the most general lookup I've discovered so far.
- There are other lookups!!
- ~crossref-add-bibtex-entry~ is for inserting bibtex entries to your bib file

This is useful as I have a single master bib file
