- How does one translate from logic to sets?
  - By using *truth sets*
    [[attachment:_20210104_192708screenshot.png]]
- The *conditional laws*
  [[attachment:_20210105_103902screenshot.png]]
- One useful equivalence is  \(P \iff Q = (P \land Q) \lor ( \neg P \land \neg Q) \)
- Be careful with biconditional equivalences!! Try to spell them, since they are tricky. Page 54 shows some of them
- The *quantifier negation laws*
  [[attachment:_20210105_111322screenshot.png]]
- *Uniqueness* is formalized as following : \(\exists !x P(x) = \exists x (P(x) \land \neg \exists y (P(y) \land y\neq x))\)
- Notice that universal conditionals are *vacuously true* if the universe of the antecedent is \(\emptyset\)  .
- Notice that \(\exists x \in A P(x) = \exists x ( \in A \land P(x))\) and that  \(\forall x \in A P(x) = \forall x (x \in A \rightarrow P(x))\)
- Notice that \(x \in \{n^2 | n \in \mathbb{N}\} = \exists n \in \mathbb{N}(x = n^2)\)
- The *universal quantifier distributes over conjunction*: \( \forall x (E(x)
  \land T(x)) = \forall x E(x) \land \forall x T(x) \) while the *existential
  quantifier distributes over disjunction*: \(\exists x (P(x) \lor Q(x)) =
  \exists x P(x) \lor \exists x Q(x)\)
- *Indexed family* : \( x \in \{ x_i | i \in I\} = \exists i \in I(x = x_i) \)
- The generalized definitions of intersection and union are actually non-trivial:
  [[attachment:_20210105_135306screenshot.png]]
  + Where families are sets constituted of other sets
  + Intersection = the contrapositive and turning into disjunction is easier to grasp \(\{x| \forall A (x \in A \lor A \notin F)\}\)
  + It is even easier to understand using indexed families. Let \(F = \{A_i | i \in I\}\) then:
    - \(\cap F = \cap _{i \in I}A_i =\{x | \forall i \in I (x \in A_i)\}\)   (x is in all indexes of the family)
    - \[ \cup F = \cup_ {i \in I} A_i = \{x | \exists i \in I (x \in A_i ) \} \] (x is there because it is in some index)
*** Chap 3 - Proof strategies
- Proofs are games of folding *givens* towards *goals*
- *Proving goals of the form*:
  - \(\neg P\):
    a. Reexpress as a positive statement
    b. Use proof by contradiction
  - \(P \to Q\):
    a. Assume P and prove Q (*modus ponens*)
    b. Prove the contrapositive: assume Q is false and prove that P is false (*modus tollens* )
  - \(P \land Q\):
    - Prove P and Q separately. Treat this as two separate goals
  - \(P \lor Q\):
    a. Assume P is false and prove Q, or assume Q is false and prove P
    b. Use proof by cases
  - \( P \iff Q\)
    a. Prove the conditionals separately
  - \(\forall x P(x)\)
    a. Let \(x\) stand for an arbitrary object and prove \(P(x)\)
  - \(\exists P(x)\)
    a. Find a value of \(x\) that makes \(P(x)\) true. Prove \(P(x)\) for this value of \(x\)
  - \(\exists !x P(x)\)
    a. Prove \(\exists P(x)\) and \(\forall y \forall x ((P(y) \land P(z)) \to y = z)\)
    b. Prove \(\exists x ( P(x)  \land \forall y (P(y) \to y = x)  ) \)
  - \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)\)
    a. Mathematical induction: Prove base case and \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N} (P(n) \to P(n+1))\) (the induction step)
    b. Strong induction: \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N} [(\foall k < n P(k)) \to P(n)]\)
- *When using a given of the form*:
  - \(\neg P\):
    a. Reexpress as a positive statement
    b. If proving by contradiction, try to prove P
  - \(P \to Q\)
    a. If given / proven P then Q follows
    b. Use the contrapositive: if given / proven Q is false, then \(\neg P\) ensues
  - \(P \land Q\):
    a. Treat as two givens
  - \(P \lor Q\):
    a. Use proof by cases. Assume P is true in case 1. Assume Q is true in case 2.
    b. If given / proven that \(\neg P\) then Q follows. THe same if Q is false
  - \(\forall x P(x)\)
    a. Plug in any value \(a\) and conclude that \(P(a)\) is true
  - \(\exists P(x)\)
    a. Introduce a new variable \(x_0\) that stands for a particular object for which \(P(x_0)\) is true
  - \(\exists !x P(x)\)
    a) Introduce a new variable \(x_0\) that stands for a particular object for
      which \(P(x_0)\) is true. Also, you may assume that \(\forall y (P(y) \to y=x_0)\)

:END:
- *Cartesian Product*:
  \(A \times B = \{(a,b) \text{  } | \text{  } a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}\)
- The Cartesian Product is fundamental because it is needed to define the truth set for statements containing two free variables !!!!!!
  + Truth set of \(P(x,y) = \{(a,b) \in A \times B \text{  } | \text{  } P(a,b)\}\)
- A *Relation* is defined as \(R \subseteq A \times B\)
- The *Domain* is defined as \(\text{Dom}(R) = \{a \in A \; | \,  \exists b \in B ((a,b) \in R)\}\)
- The *Range* is defined as  \(\text{Ran}(R) = \{b \in B \; | \exists a \in A ((a,b) \in R)\}\)
- The *inverse* is defined as \(R^{-1} = \{(b,a) \in B \times A \; | \,  (a,b) \in R \}\)
- The *composition* is defined as
  - \(S \circ R = \{(a,c) \in A \times C \; | \, \exists b \in B ((a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in S)\}\)
- A relation is *reflexive on \(A\)* if \(\forall x \in A((x,x) \in R)\)
- A relation is *symmetric* if \(\forall x \in A \forall y \in A (xRy \to yRx)\)
- A relation is *transitive* if \(\forall x \in A \forall  z \in A ((xRy \land yRz) \to xRz)\)
- Some useful facts:
  - R is reflexive iff \(i_A \subseteq R \)
  - R is symmetric iff \(R = R^{-1}\)
  - R is transitive iff \(R \circ R \subseteq Let\)
- \(R \subseteq A \times A\). It is *antisymmetric* if \(\forall x,y \in A ((xRy \land yRx) \rightarrow x = y)\)
- \(R \subseteq A \times A\). It is a *partial order* if it is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric. It is a *total order* if it is a partial order and it is also total: \(\forall x,y \in A(xRy \lor yRx)\) .
- If R is a partial order on A, \(B \subseteq A\) and \(b \in B\) there are two important concepts:
  - b is the *R-smallest element* of \(B\) if \(\forall x \in B (bRx)\)
  - b is the *R-minimal element* of \(B\) if \(\neg \exists x \in B(xRb \land x \neq b)\) which is the same as saying that \(\forall x \in R ((x,b) \in R \rightarrow x = b)\)
  - b is the *R-largest element* of \(B\) if \(\forall x \in B (xRb)\)
  - b is the *R-maximal element* of \(B\) if \(\neg \exists x \in B(bRx \land x \neq b)\) which is the same as saying that \(\forall x \in R ((b,x) \in R \rightarrow x = b)\)
- Those definitions are really important in decision theory (pareto frontier and so on )
- Some useful properties of smallest/minimal elements:
  [[attachment:_20210114_161955screenshot.png]]

- Let us prove Theorem 4.4.6
  - 1.
    - Goal: If B as a smallest element then it is unique.
      - Proof: Suppose \(b\) is a smallest element of \(B\) . Now suppose \(c\) is also an smallest element. From those two facts it follows that \(bRc\) and \(cRb\). However, since R is a partial order, it is antisymmetric, thus \(c=b\). Thus, if \(c\) is also an smallest element it must be equal to \(b\). With that the uniqueness of b, the smallest element, is demonstrated.

  - 2.
    - Goal:  \(b\) is R-smallest element of \(B\) \(\rightarrow\) it is also a R-minimal element of \(B\), and it is unique
    - Proof: Once again we will use the anti-symmetry property. Let \(b\) be a smallest element. Now suppose \((x,b) \in R\). Since \(bRx\) and \(xRb\) it follows from anti-symmetry that \(x=b\). Thus \(b\) is also a minimal element. We could have used 1 to assert that it is also unique, but let suppose a \(c\) which is also minimal. Since \(b\) is smallest \(bRc\), we from the fact that \(c\) is minimal we are lead to conclude that \(c= b\). Thus b is not only minimal, but also unique.
  - 3
    - Goal: If \(R\) is a total order \(b\) is a minimal element of \(B\) the \(b\) is the smallest element of \(B\).
- It is common to apply the notion of smallest element to sets. So one works with power sets instead of simple sets, and the smallest element, given a relation (or property),  will be the one which is a subset of all other sets which also have this property.
- *Lower bounds*  and *upper bounds* are also useful concepts closely related to smallest and largest elements:
  - Suppose R is a partial order on A; \(B \subseteq A\) and \(a \in A\)
  - \(a\) is a *lower bound* for B if \(\forall x \in B (aRx)\)
  - \(a\) is an *upper bound* for B if \(\forall x (xRa)\)
  - Note that a lower bound for B need not be an element of B !!!!!
- Other important concepts are the ones of *least upper bound* and *greatest upper bound*
- Let \(U\) be the set of all upper bounds of a partial order \(R\) on \(A\) and
  a set \(B\). Then the smallest element of U is called the *least upper bound*
- Let \(L\) be the set of all lower bounds of a partial order \(R\) on \(A\) and
  a set \(B\). Then the largest element of L is called the *greatest lower
  bound*
- It important to notice that even though a set might have an upper bound it
  might *not* have a least upper bound. For that, \(U\) would need to have a
  smallest element, and not all relations and sets will be amenable to that.
- An important notion is that of *closure*. It is the smallest set  \(L\) of the family of sets that contains another set \(M\) while having an additional property (such as reflexivity, transitivity and so on.  ) :
  - \(\mathcal{F}=\{T \subseteq \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mid M \subseteq T \text { and } T \text { satisfies some property }\}\)
- So, to prove that a relation \(S\) is a closure of another \(R\) we have to prove:
  - That \(R \subseteq S\)
  - That \(S\) actually has the property
  - That S is the smallest element of the family that has that property and contain \(R\) . That is:
    \(\text { For every relation } T \subseteq A \times A, \text { if } R \subseteq T \text { and } T \text { has the property, then } S \subseteq T \text { . }\)
- So, this notion of closure naturally leads to the notion of *reflexive closure*, *transitive closure* and *symmetric closure*

- Examples of reflexive closures: \(<\) and \(\leq\) ; \(\subset\) and \(\subseteq\)
- Now we get into the central notions of *strict partial order* and *strict total order*. The strict partial order is a relation that is *irreflexive* and transitive. Notice that the reflexive closure of a strict partial order is simply a partial order.
  - \(R\) is *irreflexive* if \(\forall x \in A ((x,x) \not \in R)\)
  - anti-symmetry follows from the combination of transitivity and irreflexivity
- A relation that is irreflexive, transitive and respects the following requirement: \(\forall x \in A \forall y \in A (xRy \lor yRx \lor x = y)\)  ; is a strict total order. Notice once again that its reflexive closure is simply a total order.
- A relation is *asymmetric* if \(\forall x \in A \forall y \in A ((x,y) \in R \to (y,x) \not \in R   )\)
- The easiest way to find a reflexive closure, \(S\), of a relation \(R\) is by adding the identity relation to the set: \(S = R \cup i_A\)
- The easiest way to find a symmetric closure, \(S\), of a relation \(R\) is by adding the inverse relation to the set: \(S = R \cup R^{-1}\)

* Exercises
- Page 81 exercise 1.d
** Section 3.3
- 2:
  + Goal
    - \(A
      \cap
       B
        \setminus
         C =
          \emptyset
          \to
          A \cap B
           \subseteq
            C\)
  + Proof
    - Suppose \(A \cap B \setminus C = \emptyset\). From the disjoint we know
      that either \(x \notin A\) or \(x \notin B\) or \(x \in C\). Now suppose \(x \in A \cap B \) . Then, necessarily, \(x \in C\). Thus if \(A \cap B \setminus C = \emptyset\) then  \(A \cap B \subseteq C\) .
- 3:
  - Goal:
    - \(A \subseteq B\setminus C \to A \cap C = \emptyset\)
  - Proof:
    - Suppose \(A \subseteq B\setminus C \). We may translate \(A \cap C = \emptyset\) as saying that if \(x \in A\) then \(x \notin C\) . Well, suppose \(x \in A\). Then from \(A \subseteq B\setminus C \) we know that it is an element of B, but not of C. Thus we have proved that \(A \cap C = \emptyset \)
- 4:
  - Given:
    - \(A \subseteq \mathcal{P}(A)\)
  - Goal:
    - \(\mathcal{P}(A) \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A))\)
  - Suppose \(X \in \mathcal{P}(A)\). Then  \(X \subseteq A\) which leads us to recognize, through \(A \subseteq \mathcal{P}(A)\),  that an element \(x \in X\)  is also an element of \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), that is \(X \subseteq \mathcal{P}(A) = X \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A))\) . This means that if \(X \in \mathcal{P}(A)\) then \(X \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A))\) . Hence, \(\mathcal{P}(A) \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A))\).
- 6:
  - Goals:
    - \(x \neq 1 \iff \text{ there is a number y s.t. } {{y + 1} \over {y-2}} = x\)
  - Solve for y. \(y = {(2x + 1) \over (1 - x )}\) . Iff \(x \neq 1\) y exists.
- 7:
  - Let \(y =  {{x + \sqrt{x^2 - 4}} \over 2 }\). Substitute it in \(y + {1 \over y} = x \).
- 8:
  - Goal:
    - \( A \in \mathcal{F}::Set(Set) \to A \subseteq \cup\mathcal{F}\)
  - Proof:
    Suppose \(A \in \mathcal{F}\). Now suppose \(x \in A\) . By the definition of \(\cup \mathcal{F}\) we have that \(x \in \mathcal{F}\), from which follows that \(A \subseteq \mathcal{F}\) and, hence, \( A \in \mathcal{F}::Set(Set) \to A \subseteq \cup\mathcal{F}\)
- 9:
  - Goal:
    - \( A \in \mathcal{F}::Set(Set) \to  \cap\mathcal{F} \subseteq A\)
    - It is easier to prove the contrapositive. Assume \( \cap\mathcal{F} \not\subseteq A\) . This means that there is an \(x\) s.t. \(x\in \cap \mathcal{F}\) and \(x \notin A\) . From the definition of intersection we know that \(x\) must be an element of all the elements of \(\mathcal{F}\) . This is only possible if \(A \notin F\).
    - Maybe it was easier to prove directly kkkkkkk
- 14:
  - Suppose \(x \in \cup_{i \in I}
     \mathcal{P}(A_i)
     \). Then there is an index s.t. \(x \subseteq A_i\) . Now suppose \(y \in x\). From \(x \subseteq A_i\) we know that \(y \in A_i\). Thus, \( y\in \cup_{i \in I}(A_i)\). Since y is arbitrary \(x \subseteq \cup_{i \in I}(A_i) \), which is the same as \(x \in
     \mathcal{P}(\cup_{i \in I} (A_i))\).
-
** Section 3.5
- 1:
  + Goal: \(A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup C\)
  + Suppose \(x \in A \cap (B \cup C)\). Since \(x \in B \cup C\) either \(x \in B\) or \(x \in C\) we have:
    - Case 1: Assume \(x \in B\). Then \(x \in A \cap B\) from which we conclude that \(x \in (A \cap B) \cup C\)
    - Case 2: Assume \(x \in C\). Then it is clear that \(x \in (A \cap B) \cup C\)
    Thus, \(A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup C\) .
- 2:
  - Goal: \( (A \cup B) \setminus C
    \subseteq
    A \cup (B \setminus C)
    \)
  - Suppose \(x \in (A \cup B) \setminus C\) . Then \(x \notin C\) and either \(x \in A\) or \(x \in B\).
    - Case 1: Assume \( x \in A\). Clearly \(x \in     A \cup (B \setminus C) \)
    - Case 2: Assume \(x \in B\). Then \( x \in B \setminus C\) and, subsequently, \(x \in A \cup (B \setminus C)\)
- 3:
  - Goal: \(A \setminus (A \setminus B) = A \cap B\)
  - Proof:
               \[\begin{aligned}x \in A \setminus  (A \setminus B) = \\
    x \in A \land (x \notin (A \setminus B))  = \\
    x \in A \land  (x \notin A \lor (x \in B)) = \\
    x \in A \land (x \in A \to x \in B)  = \\
    x \in A \land x \in B = \\
    x \in A \cap B
    \end{aligned}\]
- 4:
  - Goal: \(A \subseteq B\)
  - Given:
    + \(A \cap C \subseteq B \cap C\)
    + \(A \cup C \subseteq B \cup C\)
  - Proof
    - Suppose \(x \in A\). Then \(x \in B \cup C\), since \(x \in A \cup C\). Now either \(x \in B \) or \(x \in C\). If \(x \in B\) the proof is done. Now suppose \(x \in C\). Then it is also an element of \(A \cap C\) and hence of \(B\cap C\). Thus, \(x \in B\). Since x was arbitrary, \( A \subseteq B\).
- 5
  - Goal: \(A \triangle B \subseteq A \to B \subseteq A\)
  - Suppose \(A \triangle B \subseteq A\). Now either \(x \in B \to x \in A\)  or \(x \in A \to x \in B\). The first case is trivial. The second can be proven by using the contrapositive.
- 6
  - Goal: \(A \cup C \subseteq B \cup C \iff
    A \setminus C \subseteq B \setminus C\)
  - Proof:
    - \((\Rightarrow)\): Suppose \(x \in A \setminus C\). Then we know, from \(A \cup C\) that \(x \in B \cup C\). Now, either \(x \in B\) or \(x \in C\). We already know that \(x \notin C\). Hence, \(x \in B \setminus C\). Thus, \(    A \setminus C \subseteq B \setminus C\)
    - The converse is similar.
- 7
  - Goal: Let \(A::Set\) and \(B::Set\). \(\mathcal{P}(A) \cup \mathcal{P}(B) \subseteq \mathcal{P}(A\cup B)\).
  - Proof
    - Case 1 : \(x \in \mathcal{P}(A) \). Then \(x \subseteq A\). Hence, for any \(a \in x\) we know that it \(a \in A \cup B\). Since a is arbitrary it follows that x \(\subseteq A \cup B = x \in \mathcal{P}(A \cup B)\).
  - Case 2 is identical
- 10
  - Goal: \(|x - 3| > 3 \\to x^2 > 6x \)
  - Case 1:
    - Suppose \(|x-3| = x-3\). Then \(x-3 > 3 \to x >6 \to x^2 > 6x\)
  - Case 2:
    - Suppose \(|x - 3| = 3 - x \). Then \(3-x > 3 \to x < 0 \to x^2 > 0 \to x^2 > 6x\)
- 13
  - Let x even and let x odd and prove separately through substitution
** Section 3.6
- 2
  - Goal: \(\forall x \in \mathbb{R} \exists y (x^2y = x - y)\)
  - Proof:
    - (Existence): Let \(y = {x \over {x^2 + 1}}\). Then
      \[\begin{aligned}
      x - y = \\
      x - {x \over {x^2 + 1 }} = \\
      {{x^3 + x - x} \over {x^2 + 1}} = \\
      {{x^3}  \over {x^2 + 1 }} = \\
      x^2 {x \over {x^2 + 1}} = \\
      x^2 y
      \end{aligned} \]
    - (Uniqueness). Let \(x^2z = x -z \). Then
      \[
      x^2z = x -z \iff
       x^2z + z = x
       \\  \iff \\
        z(x^2 + 1) = x
        \\  \iff \\
        z = {x \over {x^2 + 1}}
         = y
        \]
- 3
  - Goal : \(\forall x \exists ! y(x \neq 0 \land x \neq 1 \to \frac{y}{x}  = y - x )\)
  - Proof :
    - (Existence): Let \(y = \frac{x^2}{x-1}\). Then we have that
      \[\begin{aligned}
      y - x = \\
      {x^2 \over {x-1} } - x = \\
      {x \over {x - 1}} = \\
      {x^2 \over {x^2 - x}} = \\
      {x^2 \over {x - 1}} {1 \over x} = \\
      {{x^2 \over {x-1}} \over x} = \\
      {y \over x}
      \end{aligned}\]
    - (Uniqueness) Same logic of exercise 1. Find that through algebraic manipulation \(z = y\).

  - Goal : \(\forall x ( x \neq 0 \to \exists y \forall z (zy = {z \over x}))\)

  a.
     - Goal: \(\cup!\mathcal{F} \subseteq \cup \mathcal{F}\)
       - Easy peasy. Suppose \(x \in \cup!\mathcal{F}\). Then there is an \(A_0 \in \mathcal{F} \) s.t. \(x \in A_0\). From that we already know that \(x \in \mathcal{F}\). Since x is arbitrary it follows that  \(\cup!\mathcal{F} \subseteq \cup \mathcal{F}\).

** Section 4.1
- 5
  - Goal: \(A \times (B \cup C) = (A \times B ) \cup (A \times C) \)
  - Proof:
    - \( (\rightarrow)\) Suppose \((x,y) \in A \times (B \cup C)\) . Then \(x \in A\) and \(y \in B \cup C \) . We have two cases now. Let \(y \in B\)  (Case 1). Then \((x,y) \in A \times B\). Hence \((x,y) \in (A \times B ) \cup (A \times C) \) . Now let \(y \in C\)  (Case 2). Then \((x,y) \in A \times C\). Hence \((x,y) \in (A \times B ) \cup (A \times C) \). Therefore, \(A \times (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \times B ) \cup (A \times C) \)
    - \( (\leftarrow)\) Suppose \((x,y) \in (A \times B ) \cup (A \times C)\). We know have two cases. (Case 1) Let \((x,y) \in A \times B\) . Then \(y \in B \) and \(y \in B \cup C\) . It follows that \((x,y) \in A \times (B \cup C)\) . Case 2 is similar.

  - Goal : \(\forall A,B,C ((A \times B) \setminus (C \times D) = [A \times (B \setminus D)] \cup [(A \setminus C) \times B])\)

  - Goal: \((A \times B) \cap (C \times D) = \emptyset
     \to (A \cap C = \emptyset)  \lor (B \cap C = \emptyset)\)
  - Suppose \(A \cap C\) are not disjoint and the same for \(B \cap D\). Then there is an \(a_0 \in A \cap C \) and a \(b_0 \in B \cap D\). Consequently, \((a,b) \in A \times B\) and \((a,b) \in C \times D\), which is equivalent to saying that \((a,b) \in (A \times B) \cap (C \times D)\). Hence \((A \times B) \cap (C \times D) \neq \emptyset\). Since \((a,b) \) is arbitrary:
      \((A \times B) \cap (C \times D) = \emptyset
     \to (A \cap C = \emptyset)  \lor (B \cap C = \emptyset)\)

    - Goal: \(\text{Ran}(R^{-1}) = \text{Dom}(R) \)
      + Proof: Let \( (a,b) \in R\). Then \(\text{Dom}(R) = \{a \in A \; | \,  \exists b \in B ((a,b) \in R)\} = \{a \in A \; | \,  \exists b \in B ((b,a) \in R^{-1})\} = Ran(R^{-1}) \)

    - Goal : \(T \circ (S \circ R) = (T \circ S) \circ R\)
    - Proof:
      - Let :
        - \( R \subseteq A \times B\)
        - \( S \subseteq B \times C\)
        - \( T \subseteq C \times D\)
      - \[\begin{aligned}T \circ (S \circ R) = \\
         {(a,d) \in A \times D | \exists c \in C( (a,c) \in A \times C ( \exists b \in B ((a,b) \in A \times B) \text{ and } (b,c) \in B \times C) \text{ and } (c,d) \in C \times D)) = \\
         {(a,d) \in A \times D | \exists c \in C \exists b \in B( (a,c) \in A \times C  \text{ and }    (a,b) \in A \times B \text{ and } (b,c) \in B \times C \text{ and } (c,d) \in C \times D))  = \\
         {(a,d) \in A \times D |  \exists b \in B(  (a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,d) \in T \circ S))            = \\
         (T \circ S) \circ R         \]
      - Now, a proper proof.
        - \((\rightarrow)\) Suppose \( (a,d) \in T \circ (S \circ R)  \). Then there is an \(c \in C\)  s.t. \(  (a,c) \in S \circ R \) and \( (c,d) \in T \). Since \( (a,c) \in S\circ R \) it follows that there is a \(b \in B\) s.t. \( (a,b) \in R \) and \( (b,c) \in S  \) . If \( (b,c) \in S \) and \( (c,d) \in T  \) , then \( (b,d) \in (T \circ S) \) . If \( (b,d) \in (T \circ S) \) and \( (a,b) \in R  \) it follows that \( (a,d) \in (T \circ S ) \circ   R \). Thus, if \( (a,d) \in T \circ (S \circ R)  \) then \( (a,d) \in (T \circ S ) \circ   R \).
        - \( (\leftarrow) \) Suppose \( (a,d) \in (T \circ S) \circ R \). then there is an \(b \in B \)  s.t. \( (b,d) \in (T \circ S) \) and \( (a,b) \in R \). If \( (b,d) \in (T \circ S) \), then there is a \(c \in C\) s.t. \( (b,c) \in S \) and \( (c,d) \in T \). if \( (a,b)  \in R \) and \( (b,c) \in S \) then \( (a,c) \in (S \circ R) \). From \( (a,c) \in (S \circ R) \)  and \( (c,d) \in T \) it follows that \( (a,d) \in T \circ (S \circ R) \) . Thus if \( (a,d) \in (T \circ S) \circ R \) then  \( (a,d) \in T \circ (S \circ R) \).


  - d :
    - Goal : \((S \circ R)^{-1} = R^{-1} \circ S^{-1}\)
    - Proof:
      - (\(\rightarrow\))  Suppose \( (c,a) \in (S \circ R )^{-1} \). then \( (a,c) \in S \circ R \). From that we know there is a \(b\) s.t. \( (a,b) \in R \) and \(  (b,c) \in S \).  Naturally, \( (b,a) \in R^{-1} \) and \( (c,b) \in S^{-1} \). Finally, if \( (b,a) \in R^{-1} \) and \( (c,a) \in R^{-1} \circ S^{-1}  \).
      - (\(\leftarrow\)) Suppose \( (c,a) \in R^{-1} \circ S^{-1} \). Then there is a \(b\) s.t. \( (b,a) \in R^{-1} \) and \( (c,b) \in S^{-1} \). Thus \( (a,b) \in R \) and \( (b,c) \in S^{-1} \). Thus \( (a,b) \in R \) and \( (b,c) \in S \). Clearly, \(  (a,c) \in S \circ R \). Finally, we can infer from \( (a,c) \in S \circ R  \) that \( (c,a) \in (S\circ R)^{-1}  \). Thus, if \( (c,a) \in R^{-1} \circ S^{-1} \), then \( (c,a) \in (S\circ R)^{-1} \).

- 8 :
  a. Goal: \(\text{Dom}(S \circ R) \subseteq \text{Dom}(R)\)
    -  Proof: Suppose \(a \in \text{Dom}(S\circ R)\). Then there is a \(c\) s.t.
      \((a,c) \in S \circ R\) , from which we infer that there is a \(b\) s.t.
      \(aRb\) and \(bSc\). Since \((a,b) \in R\) it follows that \(a \in
      \text{Dom}(R)\).Thus \(\text{Dom}(S \circ R) \subset \text{Dom}(R)\)
  b. We already know that \(\text{Dom}(S \circ R) \subseteq \text{Dom}(R)\). So, supoose \(a\in \text{Dom}(R)\). Then there is a \(b\) s.t. \(aRb\), from which can be inferred that \(b \in \text{Ran}(R)\). From \(\text{Ran}(R) \subseteq \text{Dom}(S)\)  it follows that \(b \in \text{Dom}(S)\). If \(b \in \text{Dom}(S)\), then there is a \(c\) s.t. \((b,c) \in S\) . So, \((a,c) \in (S \circ R)\). From that it is implied  that \(a \in \text{Dom}(S \circ R)\). thus, if \(a \in \text{Dom}(R)\) and \(\text{Ran}(R) \subseteq \text{Dom}(S)\) then  \(a \in \text{Dom}(S \circ R)\). All in all, \(\text{Ran}(R) \subseteq \text{Dom}(S)\) then  \(\text{Dom}(S \circ R) \subseteq \text{Dom}(R)\).

  - Goal: R is reflexive iff \(i_A \subseteq R\)
  - Proof:
    - \((\rightarrow) \) Suppose R is reflexive. Now suppose \((x,y) \in i_A\). Then  \(x = y \in A \). Using the reflexivity \((x,y) \in R\). Since \((x,y)\) was arbitrary \(i_A \subseteq R\).
    - \((\leftarrow)\) Similar.
- 8:
  - Goal: R is transitive iff \(R \circ R \subseteq R\)
  - Proof:
    - \((\rightarrow)\) Suppose R is transitive. Now suppose \((x,z) \in R \circ
      R\). Then there is a \(y_0 \in A\) s.t. \(xRy_0\) and \(y_0Rz\). From the
      transitivity it follows that \(xRz\). Since \((x,z)\) was arbitrary we
      have that \(R \circ R \subseteq R\)
    - \((\leftarrow)\) Suppose \(R \circ R \subseteq R\). Now suppose \(xRy\)
      and \(yRz\) . Since \(y \in A\) we have that \((x,z) \in R \circ R\) and ,
      from \(R \circ R \subseteq R\) , \((x,z) \in R\). Hence R is transitive.

    - \((\leftarrow)\)  Suppose \((a,c) \in R\). Then \(c \in B \to (c,c) \in i_B \to a,c \in i_B \circ R\)
    - \((\rightarrow)\) Suppose \(a,c \in i_B \circ R \). Then there is a \(b
      \in B \) s.t. \(a,b \in R\) and \(b,c \in i_B\). From \(b,c \in i_B\) we
      know that \(b =c\) . Hence \(a,c \in R \)

  - Suppose \((b,b) \in i_R\). Then \(b \in \text{Ran}(S)\). Then there is an \(a \in A\) s.t. \((a,b) \in S\). Then \((b,a) \in S^{-1}\). Then \((b,b) \in S \circ S^{1}\) .

  a. Suppose \(a \in A \). Then we know that \(a,a \in R_1\). thus \(a,a \in R_1 \cup R_2\), which means \(R1 \cup R2\) is also reflexive

  - \((\leftarrow)\) Too lazy
- 18:
  - Given: R and S are transitive on \(A\)
  - Goal: \(S \circ R \subseteq R \circ S \rightarrow R \circ S \text{ is transitive }\)
  - Proof:
    - Suppose \(S \circ R \subseteq R \circ S\) . Now suppose \((x,y) \in R \circ S\) and \((y,z) \in R \circ S\).
      - \((x,y) \in R \circ S\) implies that there is a \(k\)  s.t. \((x,k) \in S\) and  \((k,y) \in R\).
      - \((y,z) \in R \circ S\) implies that there is a \(w\) s.t. \((y,w) \in S\) and \((w,z) \in R\).
    - Since \((k,y) \in R\) and \((y,w) \in S\), it follows that \((k,w) \in S \circ R\). As we know that  \(S \circ R \subseteq R \circ S \) this leads to \((k,w) \in R \circ S\).
      - \((k,w) \in R \circ S\) implies that there is a \(m\) s.t. \((k,m) \in S\) and \((m,w) \in R\).
        - Given that \(S\) is transitive and \((x,k) \in S\) and  \((k,m) \in S\) it follows that \((x,m) \in S\) .
        - Given that \(R\) is transitive and \((m,w) \in R\) and \((w,z) \in R\) it follows that \((m,z) \in R\) .
    - If \((x,m) \in S\) and \((m,z) \in R\) we finally have that \((x,z) \in R \circ S\). Thus, \(R \circ S\) is transitive.

  - Incorrect assumption that y is the same in different pairs
- 20
  - Suppose R is transitive. Now suppose \((X,Y) \in S\) and \((Y,Z) \in S\). For that we needed \(Y \in B\) where \(B \neq \emptyset\). Then we know that \(xRy\) and \(yRz\) . Since \(R\) is transitive we know that \(xRz\). Since x and z are arbitrary elements of X,Z it follows that \(XSZ\), but then \(S\) is transitive too.

  - (\(\leftarrow\))Suppose \(R \subseteq i_A\). Now let \((x,y) \in R\) .Then \((x,y) \in i_A\), which leads us to conclude that \(x = y\). Thus, \(yRx\) and the relation is symmetric, but now we have that \(xRy\), \((yRx)\)  and \(x = y\), which means it is also anti-symmetric.
  - \((\rightarrow)\) Now suppose it is both anti-symmetric and symmetric. This means that if we suppose \(xRy\) we get \(yRx\)  (from symmetry), but then \(y= x\) (from anti-symmetry). Since x and y are arbitrary we get that \(R \subseteq i_A\)
- 5.
  - All proofs simply follow from \(R\). The only proof that does not follow directly from that is reflexivity. So suppose \(x \in B\) . Then \(x \in A\). Then we have that \((x,x) \in R\), since it is reflexive. But we can also infer that \((x,x) \in B \times B\) . So we have that \((x,x) \in R \cap (B \times B)\) . So it is reflexive.
- 6.
  a.
     - Reflexivity: Suppose \(x \in A \). THen \((x,x) \in R_1\) and \((x,x) \in R_2\). Thus, \((x,x) \in R_1 \cap R_2\). \(R_1 \cap R_2\) is, hence, reflexive.
     - Transitivity: Suppose \((x,y) \in R_1 \cap R_2\) and \( (y,z) \in R_1 \cap R_2\). Then \((x,z) \in R_1\) and \((x,z) \in R_2\), from which it follows that \(\((x,z) \in R_1 \cap R_2\) . Thus, \(R_1 \cap R_2\) is transitive
     - Anti-symmetry: If \((x,y) \in R_1 \cap R_2\) and \((y,x) \in R_1 \cap R_2\), we can use either to show \(x = y\). Thus \(R_1 \cap R_2 \) is anti-symmetric.
       - All in all, it is true.
  b.
     - Reflexivity holds
     - Transitivity: Suppose \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2\) and \( (y,z) \in R_1 \cup R_2\). It might not hold. It is possible that \((x,y)\) comes from \(R_1\) while \((y,z)\) comes from \(R_2\), from which we cannot conclude anything about the transitivity of \(R_1 \cup R_2\).

- 7
  a.
     - Reflexivity: Suppose \(a \in A_1\). THen \(aR_1a\), since \(R_1\) is a partial order. Thus \((a,a) \in R_1 \cup R_2\). The same can be said about an \(a_2 \in A_2\). Thus \(R_1 \cup R_2\) is reflexive.
     - Transitivity Since \(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\) either \((x,y) \in R_1\) and \((y,z) \in R_1\)  or both the two tuples are constituted of elements of \(R_2\), because y cannot be belong in both \(A_1 \) and \(A_2\).
       - Case 1: \((x,y) \in R_1\) and \((y,z) \in R_1\). It aint hard to see that \((x,z) \in R_1\), since it is partial order
       - Case 2:\((x,y) \in R_2\) and \((y,z) \in R_2\). The same as case 1!
     - Anti-symmetry: once again, we will make use of \(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\) . Suppose \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2 \). Either \(x\)  and \(y\) are both from \(R_1\) or they are both from \(R_2\). From the anti-symmetry of \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) it follows that in both cases if \((y,x)\) is also an element of the set it follows that \(y=x\). So,\(R_1 \cup R_2\) is anti-symmetric
     - Since we proved the 3 properties, \(R_1 \cup R_2\) is a partial order.
  b.
     - Reflexivity: Suppose \(a \in A_1 \cup A_2\). Then either \(a \in A_1\) or
       \(a \in A_2\). Those two cases are exhaustive. So we either have
       \(aR_1a\) or \(aR_2a\), so \((a,a) \in R_1 \cup R_2 \cup (A_1 \times
       A_2)\).

     - Transitivity:  Suppose \(x,y,z \in A_1 \cup A_2\) and  \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2 \cup (A_1 \times
       A_2)\); \((y,z) \in R_1 \cup R_2 \cup (A_1 \times
       A_2)\). We will treat \(R_1 \cup R_2\) as a single thing. Doing so leads us to 4 possible cases:
       - Case 1:
         - \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2\)
         - \((y,z) \in R_1 \cup R_2\)
         - Since \( R_1 \cup R_2\) is a partial order it follows that \((x,z) \in R_1 \cup R_2\). Thus \((x,z) \in (R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\).
       - Case 2:
         - \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2\)
         - \((y,z) \in A_1 \times A_2\)
         - We once again make use of  \(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\). It must be the case that \((x,y) \in R_1\), otherwise \(y \in A_2\), which contradicts \(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\).  So, \(x \in A_1\), \(y \in A_1\) and \(z \in A_2\). Obviously, \((x,z) \in A_1 \times A_2\). Thus \((x,z) \in (R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\).
       - Case 3:
         - \((x,y) \in A_1 \times A_2  \);
         - \((y,z) \in R_1 \cup R_2\);
         - It is analogous to Case 2
       - Case 4:
         - \((x,y) \in A_1 \times A_2 \)
         - \((y,z) \in A_1 \times A_2 \)
         - Easy, since \(x \in A_1\) and \(z \in A_2\) it naturally follows that \((x,z) \in A_1 \times A_2 \) . Thus \((x,z) \in (R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\).
       - All in all, if \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2 \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\); \((y,z) \in R_1 \cup R_2 \cup (A_1 \times
     A_2)\), then \((x,z) \in (R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\). Hence, \((R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\)  is transitive
     - Anti-symmetry: Suppose \((x,y)\) and \((y,x)\) are elements of \((R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\). There are four possible cases.
       - Case 1:
         - \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2\)
         - \((y,x) \in R_1 \cup R_2\)
         - Since \(R_1 \cup R_2\) is a partial order it follows that \(x = y\)
       - Case 2:
         - \((x,y) \in R_1 \cup R_2\)
         - \((y,x) \in A_1 \times A_2\)
         - If \((y,x) \in A_1 \times A_2\), then \(y \in  A_1\) . Since \(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\), it must follow that \((x,y) \in R_1\). But then \( x \in A_2\) and \(x \in A_1\), which we know is not true. So, this case is not possible.
       - Case 3:
         - \((x,y) \in A_1 \times A_2  \);
         - \((y,x) \in R_1 \cup R_2\);
           - Analogous to case 2.
       - Case 4:
         - \((x,y) \in A_1 \times A_2 \)
         - \((y,x) \in A_1 \times A_2 \)
           - Also not possible! Since the sets are disjoint those conditions are mutually contradictory
       - So, if  \((x,y)\) and \((y,x)\) are elements of \((R_1 \cup R_2) \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\) then \(y = x \).
  c.
     - \(R_1 \cup R_2\)
       - Suppose \(x\) and \(y\) are elements of \(A_1 \cup A_2\). Since \(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\) it may be both possible \(x \in A_1 \cup A_2\), \(y \in A_1 \cup A_2\), and that neither \(xR_1y\), \(yR_1x\), \(xR_2y\) or \(yR_2x\); we need only to pick each from a different set. For instance, \(x \in A_1\) while \(y \in A_2\). So, \(R_1 \cup R_2\) is not a total order
     - \(R_1 \cup R_2 \cup (A_1 \times A_2)\)
       - I tried to handwave my way out of that and got it wrong. Let's prove it properly.
       - Suppose \(x,y\)  are elements of \(A_1 \cup A_2\).
         - If \(x \in A_1\) and \(y \in A_2\) then \((x,y) \in A_1 \times A_2\).
         - If \(x \in A_2\) and \(y \in A_1\) then \((y,x) \in A_1 \times A_2\).
         - If \(x \in A_1\) and \(y \in A_1\) then \( (x,y) \in R_1\) (the reverse pair could have been proven) (since \(R_1\) is a total order)
         - If \(x \in A_2\) and \(y \in A_2\) then \( (x,y) \in R_2\) (the reverse pair could have been proven) (since \(R_2\) is a total order )
- 8:
  - Reflexivity: Suppose \((a,b) \in (A \times B)\). Then \(aRa\) and \(bSb\), due to their reflexivity. Consequently \(((a,b), (a,b)) \in T\). So it is, indeed, reflexive.
  - Transitivity:
    - Suppose:
      - \((a,b)T(c,d)\) \(\rightarrow\)
        - \(aRc\)
        - \(bSd\)
        - \(\{\text{By the definition of } T\}\)
      - and
      - \((c,d)T(e,f)\) \(\rightarrow\)
        - \(cRe\)
        - \(dSf\)
        - \(\{\text{By the definition of } T\}\)
    - So, \(aRe\) and \(bSf\), since they are partial orders. Once again using the defintion of T we get that \((a,b)T(e,f)\). Thus, \(T\) is transitive.
  - Anti-symmetry
    - Suppose:
      - \((a,b)T(c,d)\) \(\rightarrow\)
        - \(aRc\)
        - \(bSd\)
      - \((c,d)T(a,b)\) \(\rightarrow\)
        - \(cRa\)
        - \(dSb\)
    - Since both \(R\) and \(S\) are partial it follows from \(aRc\) and \(cRa\)that \(c=a\) and from \(bSd\) and \(dSb\) that \(b=d\). As such, \((a,b) = (c,d)\)
  - Completeness (Supposing \(R\) and \(S\) are also complete)
    - Nope, we can have \((a,c) \in R\) and \((b,d) \in S\) an as such \((a,b)T(c,d)\), but also \((c,a) \notin R\) and \((d,b) \in S\), so that it is not the case that \((c,d)T(a,b)\).
- 9
  - Reflexivity:
    Suppose \((a,b) \in A \times B\). Since \(R\) is reflexive it follows that \(aRa\). Since \(a = a\) it follows that \(bSb\).
  - Transitivity:(I handwaved a little bit) Suppose \((a,b)L(c,d)\), from that it follows \(aRc\). Alos, suppose \((c,d)L(e,f)\). From that it follows \(cRe\). (Handwave here) If we let \(a = c = e\) we also have \(bSd\) and \(dSf\). Thus, \(bSf\). \(aRe\) is an obvious result due to the handwave, so \((a,b)L(e,f)\). which means that \(L\) is transitive after all
  - Anti-symmetry: Suppose \( (a,b)L(c,d)\) and \((c,d)L(a,b)\). From that we can infer both \(aRc\) and \(cRa\). Since \(R\) is a partial order we know then that \(a= c\). This can be used to infer that \(bSd\) and \(dSb\). Since \(S\) is also a partial order we derive analogously that \(b = d\). Thus, \((a,b) = (c,d)\).
- 10
  - Suppose \( x \in A\) and \(y \in A\).
  - \((\rightarrow)\) Now suppose \((x,y) \in R\) and \(a \in P_x\). Then \(aRx\). Since \(R\) is transitive it follows that \(aRy\). So \(a\in P_y\). Since \(a\) was arbitrary we have that \(P_x \subseteq P_y\).
  - \((\leftarrow)\) Since \(R\) is reflexive we know that \(xRx\); so \(x\) itself is in \(P_x\). Now suppose \(P_x \subseteq P_y\). This means that \(x \in P_y\), leading to \(xRy\). Thus, if \(P_x \subseteq P_y\) it follows that \((x,y) \in R\).

  - Goal: If R is partial on A so is \(R^{-1}\).
  - Proof:
    - Reflexivity: Suppose \(x \in A\). Then \(xRx\), but from that it can be
      inferrend that \(xR^{-1}x\). So, \(R^{-1}\) is reflexive
    - Transitivity: SUppose \(yR^{-1}x\) and \(zR^{-1}y\). So , \(xRy\) and
      \(yRz\). Since \(R\) is transitive it also follows that \(xRz\), bu then
      \(zR^{-1}x\). Summing up, from \(yR^{-1}x\) and \(zR^{-1}y\) we wind up
      with \(zR^{-1}x\). So, \(R^{-1}\) is transitive.
    - Anti-symmetry: Suppose \(xR^{-1}y\) and \(yR^{-1}x\). From that we get
      that \(yRx\) and \(xRy\). However, we already know from the anti-symmetry
      of \(R\) that if this is the case then \(x = y\). So, if \(xR^{-1}y\) and
      \(yR^{-1}x\) we get that \(y = x\). Thus, \(R^{-1}\) is transitive.
    - It is trivial to prove that if R is total so is its inverse
- 14
  - Goal: b is R-largest of B iff b is \(R^{-1}\)-smallest of B.
    - b is R-largest of B =
      \(\forall x \in B (xRb)\) =
      \(\forall x \in B (bR^{-1}x)\) =
      b is \(R^{-1}\)-smallest of \(B\).
  - Goal: b is R-minimal of B iff b is \(R^{-1}\)-maximal of B.
    - b is R-minimal of B =
      \(\forall x \in B (xRb \to b = x)\) =
      \(\forall x \in B (b R^{-1}x \to b = x )\) =
      b is \(R^{-1}\)-maximal of \(B\).
- 15
  - An important given is that \(R_1 \subseteq R_2\)!
  - Suppose b is \(R_1\)-smallest of B. Now let \(x \in B\). Then \((b,x) \in
    R_1\). From \(R_1 \subseteq R_2\) , we get that \((b,x) \in R_2\). Since x
    is arbitrary it follows that b is also \(R_2\)-smallest of \(B\)

  - Suppose b is \(R_2\)-minimal of
    \(B\). Let \(x \in B\). If
    \((x,b) \in R_1\) then \((x,b)
    \in R_2\). Since b is
    \(R_2\)-minimal if follows that
    \(b=x\). Thus, for any \(x \in
    B\) if we let \((x,b) \in R_1\)
    too we get, using the fact that
    \(b\) is \(R_2\)-minimal, that
    \(b = x\). This is the same as
    saying that \(b\) is also
    \(R_1\)-minimal. Thus, if \(b\)
    is \(R_2\)-minimal of B it is
    also \(R_1\)-minimal of B.
- 16
  - Goal: if \(b\) is R-largest of B
    then it is also R-maximal of B
    and is unique
  - It follows neatly form Exercise
    14 composed with Theorem 4.4.3.
  - Suppose \(b\) is R-largest of B.
    Then b is \(R^{-1}\)-smallest of
    B (by exercise 14 ). By theorem
    4.4.3 we can infer that \(b\) is
    also \(R^{-1}\)-minimal of B and
    that it is unique. To say that b
    is \(R^{-1}\)-minimal amounts to
    saying that it is R-maximal
    (once again, exercise 14, part
    b). Since b is unique its been
    proved that if b is R-largest of
    B then it is also maximal and
    unique.
- 17
  - It is not true. Let \(D = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{Z}^+  \; | \; x \small{|}y \text{ and they are both odd }\}\) and let \(B = \{3,8,9\}\). 3 is the only D-minimal element, but it is not the smallest. Actually, there is no D-smallest in \(B\).
- 18
  a. Suppose \(a \in A\). Now suppose
     a is an upper bound of \(B_1\).
     Now let \(y \in B_2\). Then
     there is a \(z \in B_1\) s.t.
     \(yRz\). Since \(a\) is an upper
     bound for \(B_1\) i t neatly
     follows that \(zRa\). By the
     transitivity of \(R\) it follows
     that \(yRa\). Since \(y\) was
     arbitrary, it follows that \(a\)
     is an upper bound for \(B_2\)
     too.
  b. We will prove the contrapositive. There are two cases. Either we suppose \(b_1 \in B_1\) is a R-maximal element or we do so for \(B_2\). If \(b_1\) is a maximal element by the definition of \(B_1\) we learn that there is an \(c_2 \in B_2\) s.t. \(b_1Rc_2\). However, since \(b_1\) is a maximal element we conclude that \(b_1 = c_2\), and as such \(B_1 \cap B_2 \neq \emptyset\). The same follows for the other case. By the contrapositive, if the sets are disjoint neither of them can have a maximal element.
- 19
  - Completeness is defined for \(A\). So when he says that \(x \in B\) and argues about completeness he is missing the possibility that \(x \in A \setminus B\). This nullifies the whole proof. Besides that as usual his cases are not exhaustive.
- 20
  a. Suppose \(b\) is \(R\)-smallest of \(B\). Let \(L\) be the set of R-lower bounds of B and \(l\) be an element of it. Notice that since \(b\) is an element of \(B\) it follows from the definition of a lower bound that \(lRb\). Since \(l\) was arbitrary this amounts to saying that \(b\) is the largest element of the set of lower bounds, which is the definition of g.l.b. So, if b is R-smallest of B it must be the g.l.b of \(B\).

  b. The proof is analogous to a.
- 21
  a. Goal: \(u \in U  \land uRy \to y \in U\)
     - Proof: Suppose \(u \in U\) and \(uRy\). If we let \(b \in B\) then we have that \(bRu\), by the definition of an upper bound. Since \(R\) is a partial order, hence transitive, this means that from \(uRy\) and \(bRu\) we can infer that \(bRy\). Since \(b\) was arbitrary this means that \(y\) is also an upper bound. So, \(U\) is closed upward

  b. Goal: every element of B is a lower bound for U
     - Proof: Let \(b \in B\) and \(u \in U\). By the definition of an upper bound we know that \(bRu\). But u is any element of \(U\) so \(b\) is a lower bound for U. The thing is, \(b\) is also arbitrary, so we wind up concluding that every element of B is also a lower bound for U.

  c. Could not do it. Tried a lot.
- 22: Failed again. My intuition tells me that \(U_1 \subseteq U_2\), hence it follows naturally that \(x_1Rx_2\), as \(x_2\) is the upper bound of \(B_1\) too and \(x_1\) is smaller than all other upper bounds of \(B_1\)
- 23
  - \(\cup \mathp{F}\): Let start proving that \(\cup \mathp{F}\) is an upper
    bound. Suppose we have a set \(X\) s.t. \(X \not \subseteq \cup \mathp{F}\)
    . This means that \(X\) has elements that \(\cup\mathp{F}\) does not. Well,
    this means that \(X\) is not an element of \(F\), because if it were those
    elements would be also elements of \(\cup F\). By the contrapositive, if \(X
    \in F\) then \(X \subseteq \cup F\). Thus, \(\cup F\) is an upper bound of
    \(F\), in the subset partial order relation. Now let us prove that it is the
    least upper bound of \(F\). This means that it is the least element of the
    set \(\mathbb{U}\) of upper bounds of F. Now, suppose we have an upper bound
    \(U \in \mathbb{U}\) such that \(\cup F \not \subseteq U\). This means that
    there is an element of \(\cup F\) that is not contained by \(U\), but then
    \(U\) cannot possibly be an upper bound of F. We have arrived at a
    contradiction. So, it must be the case that \(\cup F \subseteq U\) for any
    upper bound of \(F\). Thus, \(\cup F\) is the least upper bound of \(F\).
  - \(\cap F\) is pretty similar

   a)
      - Goal: show that if a relation is asymmetric then it is also anti-symmetric
      - Proof: If a relation is asymmetric then its anti-symmetry is vacuously
        true, since the antecedent of the definition is never true.
   b) Suppose \(R\) is a strict partial order. Now suppose \(xRy\). Finally,
      lets see if we can also suppose \(yRx\). Notice that since \(R\) is
      transitive this leads to \(xRx\), but this contradicts the irreflexive
      property of \(R\). Thus, if R is a strict partial order and we suppose
      \(xRy\) we cannot also suppose that \(yRx\). Since x and y are arbitrary
      this amounts to saying that R is asymmetric. \(\blacksquare\)
4.
   a. We already know that \(S\) is reflexive. So lets prove that it is
      transitive. If we let \(S = R \cup i_A\) it is obvious that if we suppose
      \(xSy\) and \(ySz\) we will always wind up with \(xSz\) so \(S\) is
      transitive. This is not exactly a proof isn't it? So let us dwell on the
      boringness of the actual cases of the aforementioned disjunction. There
      are four of them.
      - Case 1: \((x,y) \in R \text{ and } (y,z) \in i_A \)
        - If \((y,z) \in i_A\) then \(y = z\), then \((x,z) \in R\) then \((x,z) \in S\)
      - Case 2:  \((x,y) \in R \text{ and } (y,z) \in  R\)
        - Since \( R\) is transitive \((x,z) \in R\) and as such \((x,z) \in S\)
      - Case 3:  \((x,y) \in i_A \text{ and } (y,z) \in R \)
        - If \((x,y) \in i_A\) then \( x = y \) , then \((x,z) \in R\) , then \((x,z) \in S\)
      - Case 4:  \((x,y) \in i_A \text{ and } (y,z) \in i_A \)
        + \(y = x = z \) so \((x,z) \in i_A\) so \((x,z) \in S\)
      Now to anti-symmetry. From 3.b we know that \(R\) is asymmetric and, hence, anti-symmetric. Now, since \(R\) is asymmetric the only way we can suppose \(xSy\) and \(ySx\) is if they do not come from \(R\), but rather from \(i_A\), but then \(y = x \). Thus, \(S\) is anti-symmetric.
   b. Suppose \( x \text{ and } y  \in A\). Since \(R\) is a strict total order it can be inferred that either \(xRy\) or \(yRx\) or \(y = x\). If \(xRy\) we have \(xSy\) , since \(R \subseteq S\) . The same follows for \(yRx\). If \(y= x\) we cannot say any pair of them is an element of \(R\) , since it is irreflexive, but we are not obliged to so. Actually if they are equal we can say that \((x,y) = (y,x) = (x,x) = (y,y)  \in i_A\).Since \(i_A \subseteq S\) any of these pairs are also elements of \(S\). thus, \(S\) is a total order.
5.
   a. From the definition of \(S \subseteq R\) by definition. It is also irreflexive by definition, so \( S \in \{T \subseteq A \times A \mid T \subseteq R \text{ and } T \text{ is irreflexive} \}\) . Now let \(T\) be an irreflexive set s.t. \(T \subseteq R\)  If we let \((x,y) \in T\) we know that \(x \neq y\) and as such we get both that \((x,y) \in R\) and \((x,y) \not \in i_A\). That is, \((x,) \in S\). Since they were arbitarry elements of \(T\) we have that \(T \subseteq S\). Since \(T\) itself is arbitrary we conclude that \(S\) is the largest element of the family.
   b. We already know that \(S\) is irreflexive, so we are left with the task of proving that it is also transitive, if we suppose that \(R \) is a partial order. Suppose \(xSy\) and \(ySz\). From the definition of S we can infer that \(xRy\), \(x \neq y\), \(yRz\) and \(y\neq z\). From the fact R is a partial order we can infer that \(xRz\). The missing piece now is to show that \((x,z) \not \in i_A\). contradiction. Suppose \( x = z \). If we do so we are lead by the anti-simmetry of \(R\) to conclude that given that  \(y = z = x\) . This contradicts our assumption that \(xSy\) and \(ySz\). Thus, it must be the case that \(x \neq z\). Th us, \((x,z) \not \in i_A\). Since the elements were arbitrary we can conclude that \(S\) is transitive.
