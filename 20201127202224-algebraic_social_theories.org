#+title: Algebraic Social Theories

There is a neat connection between category theory, algebraic approaches to
mathematical social science and programming, and complex systems. Algebraic
decomposition is used both to split the behavioral and strategic parts of games
and as a coarse graining techique in complex systems. Moreover, the study of
algebraic properties is also relevant for program design. I am interested in how
a categorical approach might be concretized  by this algebraic perspective.
