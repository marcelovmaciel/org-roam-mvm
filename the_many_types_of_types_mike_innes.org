This is a text about the many meanings of type, particularly for julia. So what are these meanings?

- as tags for identifying meaning
  - useful for NAMING things
- selectors for dynamic dispatch
  - those tags are used to define how we will act upon them
  - objects might have the same underlying memory layout but we want to act differently on them according to the tag
- descriptions of data layout
  - this is useful to think about the MEMORY layout of the type
  - this is done by reducing them to their constituents until we get to the ground types of julia (similar to C)
- annotations provided by type inference
  - this interacts with specialisation to get us performance
  - other languages use it for correctness as discussed below
- hints for compiler specialisation
- and constraints for compile-time correctness checking.
  - not used by julia  right now
