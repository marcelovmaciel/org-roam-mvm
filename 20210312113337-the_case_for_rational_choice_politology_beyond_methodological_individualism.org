   - Rational choice = relation, function, maximization (neumann)
   - Wont bother to discuss self-interest, though can mention
   - Why? Allocation of limited resource (opportunity cost for research),
     information, supervenience, complexification of social interaction = sem
     tempo irmao to go all the way down
   - Emergent brittlenes = the possibility of breakdown (such as prisoner
     dilemma, paradoxes, free riding) is the main contribution of the
     individualist variant and can not be ignored. But leads to interesting
     questions about levels, instead of dogmatism
   - Agents beyond individuals : Groups/collectivities/organizations, animals,
     robots;
   - Politology beyond government: theoretical framework allows rekindling the
     who gets what how of laswell (see cite:grofman20203) in a sociotechnical
     and non-anthropoteitic perspective
