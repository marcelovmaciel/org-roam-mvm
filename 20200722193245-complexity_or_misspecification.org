Is the problem of party competition truly as hard as we say or are the agents
structuring the problem differently than we theorists?

In general, if there is a choice situation we want to infer the game. If the
game is too complex there are two possibilities: they are using heuristics or
they are playing another game.

** analyze laver using analysis of algorithms
- differentiate heuristics from approximation algorithms for example
- try to understand the guarantess of each *heuristic* he gives
