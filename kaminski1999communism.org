It connects with my argument about counterfactual institutional analysis in [[file:20200711104510-bolsonaro_and_condorcet_consystency.org][Bolsonaro and condorcet consystency]]
- [[file:kaminski1998revival.org][cite: The “revival of communism” or the effect of institutions?: the 1993 polish parliamentary elections]]

:END:
- Biased polls lead to falsely auspicious scenarios for the communists
- STV and PR would have been ok for the communists, but they did not know that
- How were polls applied and what were the results?
  #+begin_quote
CBOS surveys tried
to measure electoral support indirectly, as “confidence” in different organi-
zations (including PUWP and underground Solidarity), and “confidence” in
important political figures.
  #+end_quote
  - Puwp was much better than the opposition (basically)
- The Poppe and the Church were deemed highly, so their opposition to communism and the economic downturn in 87 onward lead to a shift in the public opinion, particularly to the rejection of PUWP
- The roundtable compact's most relevant part was the electoral law (and the subject of most negotiations)

- He depicts the roundtable talks as simple games
  #+begin_quote
Every rule of premier appointment, change in the Con-
stitution, or vote on a normal bill defines a new game.
  #+end_quote
- He talks about 4 games:
  - Presidential
  - Constitutional
  - Premier Appointment
  - Legislative
- The initial proposal of PUWP guaranteed a win in all games
- The accepted proposal guaranteed its win on the Presidential and Premier Appointment game, while risking loses (given the margin of safety) in the Legislative Game. Basically, solidarity could block!
- The best outcome for solidarity would be a majority in Senate and 35% in the Sejm
- It actually got 99/100 in senate and the maximum of 35% in Sejm. It had blocking capacity
- The dropping of support of the communist regime was also related to a drop in biasing influences in polls (fear, media restriction,) and not only the economic crisis

- The PR requires PARTIES! Solidarity members were elected as individuals!!! The communists would no accept a legalized organized opposition *party*
- STV does not require parties and would also be more proportional! So it should have been ex ante preferred by both sides! Kaminski thinks not choosing it was simply a lack of knowledge about electoral rules !!!! KKKKKKKKKK That and the overly optimistic poll results was what led them to not offering a dominant proposal that was also acceptable by solidarity!

** What are the main concepts of the text?
- PUWP - The communist party of poland
- Roundtable Compact - kinda like a constitution established after bargain with the opposition (Solidarity)
- Center for Public Opinion Research (CBOS)
- Parliamentary game = simple game
  - It is a bill passing game. Either it passes, or not, or is blocked. Simple!
- Margin of safety
* Insights
- Remember to take into consideration the social desirability bias when analyzing the polls pre-bolsonaro election!
- Simple games are a neat tool!
- He does not make any generative models or anything like that, it is simply an analytic narrative. Nor does he model the different games as explicitly connected.  Maybe in cite:kaminski1998revival
