What does the book say about [[file:20200522143832-plurality_rule.org][Plurality Rule]] ? This will help me answer whether  [[file:20200531170641-is_plurality_rule_justified.org][Is plurality rule justifiable?]].

- That is does not satisfy the contraction principle (p.24)
- That it does not satisfy the condorcet principle (p.56; p.82)
- That it is a scoring rule (p.46)
- That it violates the condorcet principle more than borda does (p. 65)
- That it can elect a condorcet loser while borda cannot (p.66; 98/99)
- Nitzan also gives a characterization of plurality rule (p. 84)
- That it is susceptible to the majority tyranny (p. 119, 124, 129-30)

- Nitzan also demonstrates that ciclity implies  that there is no condorcet winner but not having a condorcet winner does not imply simplicity (p.96)

  Very unique creature.

* Insights for presentation
- The no condorcet winner does not imply ciclity thing (p.96)
- The majority tyranny thing
