* Struct questions

** What is the goal/ general argument of the text?
There is a controversy about the usage of computers in math, but the telos is their adoption
** What are the specific arguments of the text?
- Josef Urban and Christian Szegedy are using machine learning to boost existing provers
- ATPs are automated theorem provers (such as E) and use brute force methods
- ITP are like Agda and Coq (or HOL and Isabelle)
- The tendency is to mix ITPs with ATPs and with machine learning
- for Szegedy automated reasoning is a subset of nlp
-
** What are the main concepts of the text?
- ITP
- ATP
- automated reasoning
