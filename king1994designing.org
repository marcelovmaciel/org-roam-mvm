* Why am I reading this/ Where this might be useful/Which project or idea that I already have will benefit from this and how?
KKV is the main methodological work in all political science

* Struct questions

- I'll start splitting by chap1 then write a wrap up.
  
** What is the goal/ general argument of the text?
From the preface we get what they want to say:
there is a unified logic of, descriptive and causal, inference, which applies both to qualitative and quantitative research.

*** CHAPTER 1- The Science in Social Science

** What are the specific arguments of the text?

*** CHAPTER 1- The Science in Social Science
- The chapter in the end is about those two topics:
  - A definition of science;
    - There are two styles of research, but a single logic of inference
    - Science is defined by attempts at descriptive/explanatory inference (by empirics) + publicity + fallibilism + a method
    - Complexity is theory relative.
  - A definition of research design and some tips on how to improve research designs;
    - Research design is constituted of four components: research question, theory, data, and the use of the data.
    - We should aim to improve all of them.
  - + A preview of other themes.
    - *Observable implications* are central to the scientific enterprise and it is through them that we connect theory and data
    - We should aim to maximize *leverage*: "explaining as much as possible with as little as possible."
    - We should *always* Report uncertainty and be skeptical.

- 

*** CHAPTER 2 - Descriptive Inference
- Roadmap of the chap:
   - defend descriptive inference
   - discuss the contradictory goals of science
   - define inference
   - something about models of science
   - models for data collection
   - models for summarization of historical detail
   - models for descriptive inference
   - criteria for judging descriptive inferences
- Both description and explanation are important, though most research nowadays tend to privilege "explanation"
  
** What are the main concepts of the text?

- inference
- descriptive inference
- causal inference

*** CHAPTER 1- The Science in Social Science

- Techniques / Research design / Philosophy of the Social Science (p.3)
- Qualitative = non-numerical (p.4)
- Area studies (p.4)
- Case studies (p.4)
- quantitative-systematic-generalizing branch  vs  qualitative-humanistic-discursive branch (p.4)
- alike in degree (i.e., quantitative differences) or in kind (i.e., qualitative differences) (p.5)
- recipes vs precepts and rules for research (p.7)
- fallibilistic empiricism (p.7)
- scientific research (inference + publicity + uncertainty + THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD) (p.7)
- causal effects (p.7)
- principles of (data) selection (p.7)
- observation processing (p.7)
- logic of conclusions (logic of conditionals?) (p.7)
- estimate of uncertainty (p.8)
- class of events (p.10)
- counterfactual analysis (p.10)
- class of events + counterfactual analysis (p.11)
- observable implication (p.11)
- science as hypothetical dedutivism (p.12)
- research design = research question, theory, data, and the use of the data. (p.13)
- Improving questions = Social + scientific significance
- Social science theory (p.19):
  #+begin_quote
A social science theory is a reasoned and precise speculation about the
answer to a research question, including a statement about why the
proposed answer is correct.
