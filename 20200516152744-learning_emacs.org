5.4 Priorities

If you use Org mode extensively,
 you may end up with enough TODO
 items that it starts to make
 sense to prioritize them.
 Prioritizing can be done by
 placing a priority cookie into
the headline of a TODO item,
 like this:

;;*** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

 By default, Org mode supports
three priorities: ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’.
 ‘A’ is the highest priority. An
 entry without a cookie is treated
 as equivalent if it had priority
 ‘B’. Priorities make a difference
 only for sorting in the agenda
 (see Weekly/daily agenda); outside
 the agenda, they have no inherent meaning
