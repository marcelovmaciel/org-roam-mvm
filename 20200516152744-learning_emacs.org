5.4 Priorities

If you use Org mode extensively,
 you may end up with enough TODO
 items that it starts to make
 sense to prioritize them.
 Prioritizing can be done by
 placing a priority cookie into
the headline of a TODO item,
 like this:

;;*** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

 By default, Org mode supports
three priorities: ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’.
 ‘A’ is the highest priority. An
 entry without a cookie is treated
 as equivalent if it had priority
 ‘B’. Priorities make a difference
 only for sorting in the agenda
 (see Weekly/daily agenda); outside
 the agenda, they have no inherent meaning

Swiper is for searching things. It is like a much improve C s. Avy is for moving. They complement each other.

(global-set-key (kbd "M-g f") 'avy-goto-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-g e") 'avy-goto-word-0)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-g w") 'avy-goto-word-1)

Are the avy commands I ought to memorize. goto-line list lines i can jump, goto-word-0 list ALL words i can jump, goto-word-1 asks for 1 char as tip.


"C-c s s s" #'swiper
"C-c s s m" #'swiper-multi
"C-c s s i" #'swiper-isearch
"C-c s s a" #'swiper-all

Are the swiper commands. Whenever using C-s think if any of those commands should be used instead.
