#+title: On kinds of activities

To organize my [[file:20200714212154-in_which_i_define_my_agenda_organization.org][agenda]] I have to determine, first, the kinds of activities that I
perform, and where each thing will be.

I believe that I work with the following more abstract "tasks" : ideas,
questions and projects.

- *Ideas* are propositions, insights, and things like that. They stay solely in
  the zettelkasten process. Quick ideas go into the fleeting notes inbox and are
  later transformed into permanent notes.
- *Questions* , however, appear most of the theme /while/ in the zettelkasten
  system, but not only. Questions are questions that appear while studying or
  simply thinking in general. They will be left in questions-list file to be
  daily or weekly processed so that they become projects.
- Projects are anything which require multiple tasks to be concluded.
  - Writing software
  - Answering a question which appeared while studying
  - Writing a paper
