* Why am I reading this/ Where this might be useful/Which project or idea that I already have will benefit from this and how?
Of historical interest, but also clarifies the relationship between social choice and Public choice. Also, it directly discusses the debate on rationality and collective choice which I beg to differ from the classics.

  - The plott quote is from cite:plott1976axiomatic
  - Riker applied the mathematical results and also helped reconnect the threads that went all the way down to Llull
