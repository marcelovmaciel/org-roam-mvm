  Pacuit makes the same question as I did years ago:
  #+begin_quote
  The main question is whether the voting paradoxes are simply features of the
  formal framework used to represent an election scenario or formalizations of
  real-life phenomena. This raises a number of subtle issues about the scope of
  mathematical modeling in the social sciences,
  #+end_quote

  This is directly related to the probability of any of the paradoxes
  (behavioral social choice) and to showing that they indeed occurred in an
  empirical setting (riker vs makie). This has obvious normative implications.

  *My notes, particularly from Nurmi, are relevant here*

  Given the  PhD selection procedures, the work of Sean Ingham is also important.
