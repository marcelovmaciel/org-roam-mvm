From [[https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/04/26/adding-part-1-and-mr-fibonacci/][3. Adding (Part 1) and Mr Fibonacci | Graphical Linear Algebra]] I get the
great distinction betweeen algorists and abacists. My interest in the
appplication of the Formal Sciences is actually with the intention of updating
our conceptual empirical and actual political tooling with the intention of
improving our odds of cracking the self-government puzzle set up by Madison. I
see myself pretty much as an algorist.
