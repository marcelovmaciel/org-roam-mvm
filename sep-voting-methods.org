  One is to use algorithms analysis to study complexity of manipulation (both
  meanings). The second is to view voting as an optimization problem. Two

It is to model mathematically a voting procedure and derive it from atomic
definitions and to show it is subject to some axioms.

 Approval Voting: Each voter selects a subset of the candidates (where the empty
set means the voter abstains) and the candidate(s) with selected by the most
voters wins.

  #+begin_quote
  Negative voting is tantamount to allowing the voters to support either a
  single candidate or all but one candidate (taking a point away from a
  candidate C is equivalent to giving one point to all candidates except C).
  That is, the voters are asked to choose a set of candidates that they support,
  where the choice is between sets consisting of a single candidate or sets
  consisting of all except one candidate. [Approval voting] generalizes this
  idea by allowing voters to choose any subset of candidates:

- Definition :
  - When a majority of voters weakly support an alternative while a minority strongly prefers another alternative.

- Solutions:
  - Super-majorities
  - Ballots that express intensity of preferences (such as quadratic voting).

  #+begin_quote
The idea is to think of an election as a market (Posner and Weyl, 2018, Chapter
2). Each voter can purchase votes at a costs that is quadratic in the number of
votes. For instance, a voter must pay $25 for 5 votes (either in favor or
against a proposition). After the election, the money collected is distributed
on a pro rata basis to the voters. There are a variety of economic arguments
that justify why voters should pay $v^2$ to purchase v votes (Lalley and Weyl
2018b; Goeree and Zhang 2017). See Posner and Weyl 2015 and 2017 for further
discussion and a vigorous defense of the use of Quadratic Voting in national
elections. cite:sep-voting-methods

Proxy voting is when agents can delegate their vote on some issues. Liquid
Democracy is when votes can be further delegated.

 It is when no voter had an alternative as choice but the alternative wins.
  Happens in referendums when one votes for each issue separately.
