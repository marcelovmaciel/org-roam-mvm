definitions and to show it is subject to some axioms.

  #+begin_quote
  Negative voting is tantamount to allowing the voters to support either a
  single candidate or all but one candidate (taking a point away from a
  candidate C is equivalent to giving one point to all candidates except C).
  That is, the voters are asked to choose a set of candidates that they support,
  where the choice is between sets consisting of a single candidate or sets
  consisting of all except one candidate. [Approval voting] generalizes this
  idea by allowing voters to choose any subset of candidates:

  - When a majority of voters weakly support an alternative while a minority strongly prefers another alternative.

- Solutions:

  #+begin_quote
The idea is to think of an election as a market (Posner and Weyl, 2018, Chapter
2). Each voter can purchase votes at a costs that is quadratic in the number of
votes. For instance, a voter must pay $25 for 5 votes (either in favor or
against a proposition). After the election, the money collected is distributed
on a pro rata basis to the voters. There are a variety of economic arguments
that justify why voters should pay $v^2$ to purchase v votes (Lalley and Weyl
2018b; Goeree and Zhang 2017). See Posner and Weyl 2015 and 2017 for further
discussion and a vigorous defense of the use of Quadratic Voting in national
elections.

Proxy voting is when agents can delegate their vote on some issues. Liquid
Democracy is when votes can be further delegated.

  Happens in referendums when one votes for each issue separately.

  There are two kinds of manipulation. The first is *control* through an
  authoritative figure, I believe an example to this is mckelvey classic paper.
  The other kind of manipulation is *misrepresentation of preferences* by
  voters. This is what [[file:sep-social-choice.org][the gibbard satterwhaite theorem]] is about.

always better for it.

  It is a kind of monotonicity failure (or paradox). In this case is when more
  voting showing up, supporting, an alternative not necessarily is better for
  the alternative. Actually, cite:Moulin_1988 shows that all methods are
  amenable to the no show paradox.

  It is when the result changes for a voting procedure if we split the
  population into subgroups (districts). As with the nonshow paradoxs this happens with all condorcet consistent paradoxes. For more on
  that see cite:Zwicker

It is a generalization of both *Majority Rule*, its variants AND *Unanimity Rule*.

Each voter selects one alternative, and the winning alternatives are those that receive at least $q \times \#V$  votes where $\#V$ is the number of voters.

In majority rule $q = 0.5$  while in unanimity rule its equal to 1.
