* Insights

One thing that I have concluded is that there are actually four logical levels
of choice:

1. Deciding to become a group or to keep as group;
2. deciding how to decide - constitutional choices;
3. collective decisions
4. operational decisions.

# ----------------------------------------------------------
That the rule to be used in the electoral process depends on social stability.
This argument was made by [[file:dahl1989democracy.org][dahl1989democracy: Democracy and its critics]] too. lol


* What are the reasons for becoming a group?

- Gains are bigger than the costs (p.12)

Implicit here is the opposite question:
*What are the reasons for exiting a group?*
- Costs are bigger than gains
- Exit costs, however, tend to be huge (p. 28).



* What are the reasons for choosing in group?
(p.7)
- Information
- Legitimacy


* How do we differ judgment from preferences?

(p.19)

*Preferences are disputes over ends, over values*. They are not simply tastes,
 people can make arguments about them, convince others, discuss the sources of
 disagreement.

 *Judgements are disputes over means*. Given a goal, what are the best means? Even

* What are the three stages of choosing in groups?
 - Deciding how to decide how to decide
   - AS IF this was a "choice". This is the hobberian moment. 
 - Deciding how to decide
 - (collective) Deciding

* What are the objects of constitutional rules?

(P. 29)

- Rules on how to choose
- Who can enter the group
- How can members leave the group
- How rules can be changed 

* On the artifice of contractarian theorists (p.31)
They collide becoming a group and setting the rules of the group as the some
"constitutional moment". Obviously this is not true, it is only a theoretical
artifice.

Colliding the two of them is a rationalist simplification.

* On selecting a decision rule (p.137)
They specify some steps for selecting a decision rule.

- Define who are the members of the group
- Define the alternatives
- Define evaluative criteria
- Specify the decision rules
- Decide which decision rule is the best given the group - alternatives -
  evaluative criteria.


I would add the following step:
- Decide what are we asking from the group.

So we would have the following steps for selecting a decision rule:

1. Define who are the members of the group
2. Decide what are we asking from the group
3. Define the alternatives
4. Define evaluative criteria
5. Specify the decision rules
6. Decide which decision rule is the best given the group - alternatives -
   evaluative criteria.
* P. 139 has an example of plurality not choosing a condorcet winner

asdfasdf
* Why IIA matters?
This follows from Satterthwaite. Without IIA the system is too manipulable. Borda count is an example of manipulable system


* P. 155 on choice of electoral system

Using cite:mueller2003public they argue that plurality rule should be used in
legislative elections if we care more about quick decisiveness than societal
representation (in the sense of mirroring ).

It is like a choice between dynamic decisiveness vs dynamic legitimacy.

cite:mueller2003public p. 296 has a counterpoint against plurality.

Maybe cite:dougherty2011calculus matters here too.
