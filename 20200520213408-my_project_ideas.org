  Pacuit makes the same question as I did years ago:
  #+begin_quote
  The main question is whether the voting paradoxes are simply features of the
  formal framework used to represent an election scenario or formalizations of
  real-life phenomena. This raises a number of subtle issues about the scope of
  mathematical modeling in the social sciences,
  #+end_quote

  This is directly related to the probability of any of the paradoxes
  (behavioral social choice) and to showing that they indeed occurred in an
  empirical setting (riker vs makie).

  *My notes, particularly from Nurmi, are relevant here*


* inductive party competition
use dedeo ?

* what is the ideational structure of parliamentary discourse hin brazil
- What remains?  What has changed?
- Saquarema vs luzias
- WGS interview in which he gives the typical leftist diagnosis of the problems of brazil


* Tomasello -> shared and collective intentionality vs stakes
- One important concept is the one of *intentionality*
- shared and collective intentionality are also something that should be in my nuts and bolts


* On the relationship between intentionality and teleology
- Connect rationality, intentionality and teleology https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02230.pdf#page30

* (Preferences x Attitudes) and Environment
- Give an information theoretic account of when we can use preferences and when
  attitudes is all we CAN use

* evolutionary gans
rock paper and scissors

- QRE might be useful too
- As well as mckelvey last paper !



* the unity and originality of wgs thought as a public choice theorist

* a political theory of reflevixity
