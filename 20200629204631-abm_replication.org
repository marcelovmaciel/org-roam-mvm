  Replication is a way of learning as such I intend to replicate some social
  simulation studies. I have a folder with papers to replicate. Besides them
  there is Osmar Guerrero works, social choice monte carlo studies (research
  that), bruno's work with bernardo, the hamburg listed paper and many more.

  One thing to do is to use the methods I've used in my dissertation + laver's
  usage of \(\hat{r}\) statistics + cite:siegel18_analy_comput_model methodology.
