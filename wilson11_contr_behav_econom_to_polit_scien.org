* Why am I reading this/ Where this might be useful/Which project or idea that I already have will benefit from this and how?
- Useful in general for experimental methods
- particularly useful for rice application

* Struct questions

** What is the goal/ general argument of the text?
Behavioral economics is about understanding violations of the standard model.
** What are the specific arguments of the text?
- Classes of violation:
  - social preference
  - time discounting
  - context (framing)
  - overconfidence
  - strategic constraints (multi-level thinking)
  - emotions
  - status differentials
- Different approaches (from Khalil 2009):
  1. Revise theory: tinker utility functions
  2. Import psychology: add heuristics into models
- Loss aversion leads people to behave weirdly with loss and with 0 utility
- Status quo bias (also known as endowment effect) is something to beware. Particularly for my argument about institutional reform.
- Multilevel-thinking:
  - Nagel (1995):
    - People learn to think in levels
    - Modal subject is level 2
    - Great majority $\leq$ 3
