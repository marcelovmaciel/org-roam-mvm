  One thing that is missed by most of the literature on political philosophy is that democratic theory *is* positive theory. Though people might want to split them apart this is impossible.

    The deliberative literature not only gives new normative guidelines, it also presents new positive concepts to analyze society. Like publics and counterpublics and networked publics.

    The same can be said about the republican theory and its focus on power and domination.

    What are the positive concepts within those theories? What are the ontological concepts and explanatory models?
