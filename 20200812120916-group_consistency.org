When can we use the rct models? Ross argues for a view of agents akin to
machines. Amadae even has a paper on that. The thing is: how can we say
something is consistent? What is the boundary of inconsistency? What is the role
of institutions and organizations in creating such consistency? Can they be seen as some kind of consistency funnell? If so, how?  Why we treat
individuals as consistent?

This is first and foremost a mix of formal and empirical question, but now i think mostly of philosophical references.

- Espstein, List, Spierkeman and Dietrich are the main names for Rational groups.

- Since this idea connections with group agency, it can be applied to : classes
  (through social structure, sally haslanger), people (and ingham work here!
  most of his papers are in my .references), and parties (here ypi's work, but
  also downs and laver, maybe even bolleyer).
