#+title: Ideational structure in parliamentary discourse
- tags :: [[file:20210302091557-democracy_and_insatisfaction_wgs_and_social_choice.org][Democracy and insatisfaction: WGS and social choice]]

what is the ideational structure of parliamentary discourse in brazil? What
remains? What has changed? Is the Saquarema vs luzias persistent in how
politicians see things? Or the frame is another one and this framing is merely
intellectual ? What is the story they tell themselves? WGS interview in which he
gives the typical leftist diagnosis of the problems of brazil is a possible
source of inspiration. Riker's work on heresthetics is useful here, as well as
cite:chambers17_balan_epist_qualit_equal_partic discussion on framing of issues.
