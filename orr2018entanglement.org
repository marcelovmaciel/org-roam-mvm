* Why am I reading this/ Where this might be useful/Which project or idea that I already have will benefit from this and how?
This is directly related to my note about [[file:20200825143750-young_habermas_project.org][Young Habermas project]] and to [[file:20200824211623-my_weltanschauung_2.org][My
Weltanschauung 2]]. That is, how to reorient politology beyond a technocratic and
shortsighted perspective about is role within society.

:END:
- They start setting the stage
- institutios are the rules of the game
  - Coordinating tools
  - who does what to whom for what purposes + rule breaking response
- democracy as citizens participation, particularly through vertical accountability
- Democracy = deliberation + voting (market and forum elster and so on)
- Democracy has the final saying on institutional arrangements within the democratic order (priority of democracy )
- Insulated experts lead to private interests and private knowledge and in the end become "the willing tools of big economic interests".
- They consider, however, that a better criticism is that the technocratic vision misunderstands political inquiry. That is, what kind of knowledge is needed, generated and disseminated in political economics.
- They situate themselves within pragmatic counters to the technocratic view. Descendants of Dewey such as Cartwright, Kitcher, Anderson and Putnam
- Their focus is methodological: models/mechanisms/metrics
- Evidence-based approaches are shortsighted. One ought to attent to how evidence is generated, assessed and incorporated into the political process
- Modes as tools that help in communicating (Schelling) -> departure from realism x instrumentalist debate
- As johnson admits, in the end this is an instrumentalist position, but one that emphasizes communicative utility instead of making testable predictions. 
- Why this matters? the debate is purely in empirical terms, and schelling is shifting into a conceptual realm.
- Models are instruments of practical reasoning
- reasons (preferences and beliefs) are a class of causal  mechanisms
- Models as tools to *entertain possibilities*
- The residential seggregation model is an example of conceptual exploration in which there is a entaglement of positive and normative considerations.
- Johson tends to focus on game theoretic models as tools to explore unseen causal mechanisms related to the reasons of agents. He's got a reason-centric approach. In this he differs from ostrom who takes a situation-centric approach

  - Beyond exploring mechanisms Schelling also points out that models are also useful for discussing mechanisms that are *beyond* the mathematical structure of the model. They are "incidental detail" that we cast aside while constructing the model but that the analysis of the model takes us back to them. Focal points is an example!!!!

- This aligns perfectly with the paper of Aumann. Games are underdetermined, they allow us see the strategic structure, but their actual solution requires MORE. 

- STOPPED ON PAGE 65

- models as explorations of possibilites

[[attachment:_20200902_223404screenshot.png]]

- He frames schelling as viewing models as communicating tools while Ostrom as seeing them as vehicles of imagination
- Collective action problems do not REQUIRE any particular institutional mechanism. There are many possibilities
- Areas ostrom identified as relevant:
  - membership
  - appropriation rights,

  - collective decision—making

  - monitoring of performance,

  - and dispute resolution
- Those areas should be *close* to members
- He argues against the impossibilities view. Models do not capture ineluctable constraints!
- On the entaglement of positive and normative in ostrom :
  [[attachment:_20200902_225038screenshot.png]]
- Sen is a deliberationist. So he views himself as collaborating to public discussion as vehicle of social change and economic progress
- The complementary nature of Sen and Ostrom theories of democracy:
  [[attachment:_20200902_225821screenshot.png]]
- That is, one is a deliberationist, while the other is a realist communitarian participacionist
- For Johnson, the capabilities theory of Sen also complements positively Ostrom's theory.
- Capabilities are related to opportunities, not to choices (even less to utilities)
- Capabilities as *metric*
- What is the relationship between Sen and Sugden freedom based theories? (One is negative and the other is positive)
- The solution of Sen is that identifying and weighting capabilities is up to citizens and NOT to a "central" expert
- Capabilities therefore presuppose an institutional scaffolding "consist in procedures, rules, and so forth that structure how capabilities are
debated, promoted, inhibited, sustained, and so forth"
- And here is where Sen needs ostrom. If she lacks capabilities, particularly capacity for self-governance, he lacks institutions
- libertarian paternalism as the new technocratic face
- Rodrik as in the steps of schelling ostrom and sen
- *Their conclusion is very important and I must scan it properly*
- Division of labour is necessary + scientific knowledge is hard to generate/certify/disseminate. Public knowledge, however, matters, and must be generated by citizens too.
- Dissemination of inquiry - in democratic politics instead of simply applied to.
- They defend a view that tries to update Dewey's vision through ostrom+sen+schelling but without being as naive about science or democracy
- They do, however, defend an expansion of the scope of democratic participation
- Participatory and deliberative institutions as metainstitutions
- The basic point is:
  #+begin_quote
In the domain of political-economic policy, methodological con
cern for models, mechanisms, and metrics is deeply entangled with commitment to democratic
possibilities.
  #+end_quote
- This no panacea approach leads to an interesting ethical perspective: solving problems instead of approximating an ideal. If we are against panaceas we should also be against normative panaceas and systems of principles such as the ones envisioned by kantians and utilitarians (notice that binmore might actually be exempt here). This resonates deeply with Wiens program!
- Normatively, therefore, they defend a *tempered (or comprehensive) consequentialism*, in which culmination outcomes is the focus, but entangled with procedural concerns like fairness and reflexity.
- Do we supply proper conditions for intelligent judgment in our polyarchical societies?[[file:20200711104510-bolsonaro_and_condorcet_consystency.org][ Bolsonaro and condorcet consystency]]  and my presentation for Hamburg argue that we do not - [[file:20200531170641-is_plurality_rule_justified.org][Is plurality rule justifiable?]]. Can I incorporate capabilities in my account? or an ostromnian or pragmatist flavour?
