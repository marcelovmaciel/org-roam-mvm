  It is when the result changes for a voting procedure if we split the
  population into subgroups (districts). As with the [[file:20200529170933-what_is_the_nonshow_paradox.org][What is the nonshow
  paradox?]] this happens with all condorcet consistent paradoxes. For more on
  that see cite:Zwicker

  It can be seen as an example of Simpson's paradox.
