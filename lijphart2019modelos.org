- (p.293) The conventional wisdom is that majoritarian governments are more
  decisive therefore more efficient. Supposedly there is a trade-off between
  decisiveness and representativeness. cite:lijphart2019modelos shows that this
  is false (p.293-*308*).

- (p340) Proportional representation matters a lot for the consensualism of a system

- (p.344) There is some sort of causal chain:
   proportional representation $\rightarrow$ multipartisanship  $\rightarrow$ coalitional governments
- (p.343) Culture matters for the choice of political institutions
