  One can justify and analyze social choice using a *procedural* (the right way)
  view or an *"epistemic"* (consequentialist).

  The most general article in the epistemic program is cite:Pivato_2012 .
  Conitzer also has some works on this approach (seeing SCFs as mles;
  cite:Conitzer_2013). This epistemic view is directly relevant to a project idea of using social choice to study ensembles.

  The thing is, I believe both approaches can be subsumed by cite:list2011logical view of general aggregation and cite:patty2015aggregation view that social choice is a general blueprint for any kind of political theory.
