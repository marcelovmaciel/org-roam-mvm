- What are the main foundational books in public choice?
  - From 1957 to 1965:
    -

  - Important books until 71
    [[attachment:_20210302_150830screenshot.png]]
- He adds some important caveats to the narrative of economic imperialism. Public choice was never mainstream
- Also, Public Choice is not the same as rational choice modeling nor positive political theory
  #+begin_quote
But viewing Public Choice and rational choice
as synonymous is inconsistent with the views of some of the key figures in
Public Choice.
  #+end_quote
- A further take:
  Public choice is seen as unified due to Tullock syncretic perspective as editor and Riker's proselytism
- Herein lies another argument that reinforces the distinction between public choice and social choice:
  #+begin_quote
James
Buchanan, from the beginning, distinguished Public Choice (especially that
portion of it that later became known as constitutional political economy)
from social choice, and did not attach great importance to Arrow's and related
work, since in his view, societies were not like individuals and thus it was not
particularly troubling that they did not behave as such.
  #+end_quote
  - Remember cite:mclean14_stran_histor_social_choic_contr and [[file:20200721204708-criticism_of_rat_individualism.org][Criticism of rat individualism]]
- Public Choice is more methodological individualist than rational choice focused
  #+begin_quote
, Buchanan is careful to talk about economics as the study of
exchange, not as the science of optimization
  #+end_quote
- One great argument he makes is that the works of public choice and social choice are among the greatest normative political theory works there is. I agree.
  #+begin_quote
Also, works such as Arrow, and
Buchanan and Tullock, and even large portions of, say, Downs, Black, and
Olson, are best viewed as contributions to normative political philosophy -
as such, in my view, they among the best such normative work being done
by anyone, especially with respect to issues of representation and democratic
theory.

- He makes a good comment about rational choice modeling
  #+begin_quote
, the general thread is a simple one: there is no such as the rational
choice model of any phenomenon, only a rational choice model (Wuffle,
1999). Moreover, even when rational choice models appear wrong, they are
"usefully wrong." I refer to models that generate empirical conundrums as
"usefully wrong" when those models help us to think more clearly about how we need to modify our theories (or rethink our stylized facts) in order to make
sense of the world.
  #+end_quote
- There are, at least, three types of works on cycles
  #+begin_quote
(a) analytic and simulation results for the impartial culture and related distri-
butions (e.g., Black, 1958; Gerhlein and Fishburn, 1976 a, b); (b) theorematic
results apparently showing that cycles are inevitable unless highly restrictive
and empirically implausible assumptions are met (Sen, 1970); and (c) work
on generic cycling in majority rule voting in a multidimensional issue space
(Mckelvey, 1976, 1979; cf. Riker, 1982).
