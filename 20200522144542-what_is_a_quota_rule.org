** Back
It is a generalization of both *Majority Rule*, its variants AND *Unanimity Rule*.

Each voter selects one alternative, and the winning alternatives are those that receive at least $q \times \#V$  votes where $\#V$ is the number of voters.

In majority rule $q = 0.5$  while in unanimity rule its equal to 1.
