#+title: On the three passes method

* Three passes method
[[http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf]]

** First pass

This pass should take about five to ten minutes and *consists of the following steps*:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off theones you’ve already read

At *the end*, answer the 5 Cs:
1.Category: What type of paper is this?  A measure-ment paper?  An analysis of an existing system?  A description of a research prototype?

2.Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?

3.Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?

4.Contributions: What are the paper’s main contribu-tions?

5.Clarity: Is the paper well written ?

** Second pass

*Read the paper with greater care*, but ignore details such as proofs. *It helps to jot down the keypoints, or to make comments in the margins*, as you read.  Remember to *mark relevant unread references* for fur-ther reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper)

*After this pass*, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper.You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the pa-per, with supporting evidence, to someone else

** This pass
Reimplement the paper. Careful dissection of the paper.
