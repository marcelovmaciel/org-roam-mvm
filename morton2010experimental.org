* Why am I reading this/ Where this might be useful/Which project or idea that I already have will benefit from this and how?
Morton is a relevant EITM proponent, which can be seen as a search for unification within a logical empiricist epistemology. Her favoured route, however, is indeed interesting : experimental research + formal theory. Most of the examples are about information and voting, so the book not only teaches concepts, but instantiates them with cool, though outdated, papers.



* Struct questions

** What is the goal/ general argument of the text?
In general, is to teach experimental methods for political scientists
** What are the specific arguments of the text?
** What are the main concepts of the text?
