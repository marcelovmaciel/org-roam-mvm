** Introduction
 "[[file:20200531170641-is_plurality_rule_justified.org][Is plurality rule justifiable?]]"

Though seemly trivial the question poses a plethora of conundrums upon
reflection. It is a general question, and a strategy of resolution is to start
decomposing it.

(fancy shading of is plurality rule and bold justifiable)

Let's zoom on justifiable.

"What is justifiable?"

Justifiable means that an act or belief is capable of being justified - which
means there are good reasons for the act, or that the reasons for doing it
outweigh the reasons against it. There are two routes that can be followed here.
One is to start after the act and see whether there are reasons that justify it.
"Alice killed the Red Queen. Was she justified in doing so?" It amounts to
analyzing concrete action situations. The second route is to think before any
act at all. This is an abstract inquiry about the general justifiability of an
act. For example: "Is killing justified?" This is the route I'll follow, though
the example already insinuates the importance of context and we'll end up
getting back to the first interpretation of the question.

Hereafter, arguably, we can work with the following question :
"Is using plurality rule justified?"

The question begs an agent, a time and a place, but let keep them at bay, for
now, and go to plurality rule.

"What *is* plurality rule ?"

It is a voting procedure. Procedure is defined here as in the colloquial
programming parlance: a series of computational steps to be carried out. If we
have a set of alternatives and a set of "agents", a voting procedure first
collects information from agents regarding the alternatives, the *ballots*,
through a *ballot procedure* that specifies what the information is, and
*aggregation procedure* which specifies how the collected information is used to
select one or more elements from the alternatives
(cite:Goodin_2006,sep-voting-methods).

So a voting procedure is a mechanism for making a collective choice, where
collective choice is any situation in which there is group of agents and a goal
of selecting an element or subset of the alternatives based on attributes of
those agents regarding those alternatives. Notice that "agents" are not
necessarily human individuals, but is actually a placeholder for some sort of
information source which will be queried by the ballot procedure. A single
individual, human, can end up using a voting procedure if he has three
information sources and want to aggregate those sources into a choice. So a voting
procedure might be used in a single person decision making situation. Lets
bypass that and the fact that "agents" can also be "robots", any classifier in
machine learning for example, animals or any information source.


Plurality rule is the collective choice rule which asks agents for an element of the
alternatives, their "most preferred", and chooses the one with highest count.

Ok, both plurality rule and justification have been defined so the stage has
been set for a new look at the question.

"Is using plurality rule justified?"

->

"Is always using plurality justified?"

Is sometimes using plurality rule justified?"

"Is using plurality rule never justified?"

To answer any those questions I'll first answer the next question:

"What criteria can be used to judge a voting method?"

Why disambiguate the question into three and think of criteria? Try answering
"Is killing justified?" A quick answer can be: "If in self-defense, yes". Which
would make it dependent on the *situation* at hand, but if the person to whom
this question may be posed follows some kind of categorical imperative the
quick, and unique, answer would be: "No, never." So trying to answer the
question points us to criteria. If the criteria is "conditional" this also leads
to the notion of *situation*.

Time limits foreclose deriving the criteria from the definition of a collective
choice.

So lets start with a typology of criteria:

** Principles, criteria and perspectives

I'll start differentiating between a dynamic and static view, and an isolated
and networked view of collective decision making. This will interact with
principles and criteria.

Static view are those in which the collective choice is analyzed as if a
one-shot situation. The dual of the static view is obviously to see the
collective choice as an iterative endeavor - the dynamic view.

Also one can see the collective choice situation as a closed - isolated - system
or as an open system which interacts with other collective choice situations in
an "ecology" or network of such situations. 

There is also a distinction about "mode of interaction": is it a collective
choice about collective choice ("constitutional"), a collective choice about
individual choice, or an individual choice.


- static criteria
  - procedural criteria
  - epistemic criteria
  - utilitarian criteria
  - majoritarian criteria
  - pratical criteria
  - probability of paradoxes

- dynamic criteria




** cruft


# cite:Goodin_2006 have the
# great insight that every collective choice procedure is the composition of a
# *ballot procedure*, which determines how information is collected from agents
# regarding the alternatives, and an aggregation procedure which specifies how the
# information contained in the ballots is folded into a choice. An election is the
# most obvious example of this situation.

# Whenever we have a set $A$ of
# alternatives and some index $I$ and we want to first for each $i \in I$ select
# with a *ballot procedure* $f^b$ some subset of $A$ which might be a singleton
# set, a set, a vector, a list of tuples; and after applying among those ballot
# elements use some other *aggregation procedure* that folds the result


# From that abstract presentation it is clear that there are many "contexts"
# situations in which a collective choice rule can be used. From a purely
# formalist and static (we are only thinking about an isolated choice situation)
# point of view, we have to inquiry what is the goal (prediction, legitimacy,
# welfare), which will lead to what kind of information is being asked from
# agents, how this information will be collected, the number of agents, the number
# of alternatives,. Should we care about all those variables though?

justifiable as acceptable

do you think we could be able to justify the use of plurality rule.


when it is used, what people think about it , is it a good idea
