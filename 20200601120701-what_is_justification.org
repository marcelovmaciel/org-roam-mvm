#+end_quote

On justified[fn:dict2]

always justify the means. to defend or uphold as warranted or well-grounded:

So it is related to reason. What is reason?

** [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason-action/][Pratical Reason]] and the Structure of Actions

From this entry (cite:sep-practical-reason-action) the only relevant information
is that practical reason is about figuring out what to do, and that one can
contrast action with "mere activity/behavior"

** [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/][Reasons for Action:]] Justification, Motivation, Explanation

Reasons are related to practical reasoning: about action which is guided by principles, justified by them. People deliberate about what and how to act. This is relevant for my problem.  The question [[file:20200531170641-is_plurality_rule_justified.org][Is plurality rule justifiable?]] is about practical reasoning in a collective context, which will lead us to [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justification-public/][public justification]]. Let's save this insight for now.

So, people don't only merely act, but also act guided  by some principles or criteria. We can also say they act guided by *reasons*. But what exactly are reasons? cite:sep-reasons-just-vs-expl argues that there are three kinds of reasons for actions:

#+begin_quote
[...] *“normative”* reasons—that is, reasons which, very roughly, favour or
justify an action, as judged by a well-informed, impartial observer; and
*“motivating”* reasons—which, again roughly, are reasons the “agent” (that is,
the person acting) takes to favour and justify her action and that guides her in
acting. But there are, in addition, *“explanatory”* reasons, reasons that
explain an action without necessarily justifying it and without being the
reasons that motivated the agent.

[...]

A *normative reason* is a reason (for someone) to act—in T. M. Scanlon’s phrase,
“a consideration that counts in favour of” someone’s acting in a certain way
(1998 and 2004).

[...]

A reason is said to be a “normative reason” for acting because it favours
someone’s acting. But what does it mean to say that a reason “favours” an
action? One way of understanding this claim is in terms of justification: a
reason justifies or makes it right for someone to act in a certain way. This is
why normative reasons are also called “justifying” reasons.

[...]

Whether it would be right for me to tell the joke, whether I have an
“all-things-considered” reason to tell it, will depend on whether either of the
reasons is stronger than the other.

[...]

As Austin noted (1957), we must distinguish between a justification and an
excuse. When accused of wrongdoing, one may offer a justification, which aims to
show that in fact the thing done was right because there was reason for doing
it. Alternatively, one may offer an excuse: admit that one did the wrong thing
but plead to be partly or wholly exculpated—for instance, because it was done
out of ignorance or mistake.

[...]

A *motivating reason* is a reason for which someone does something, a reason
that, in the agent’s eyes, counts in favour of her acting in a certain way. When
an agent acts motivated by a reason, she acts “in light of that reason” and the
reason will be a premise in the practical reasoning, if any, that leads to the
action.

[...]

someone’s goal or intention in acting, which is something the agent desires (to grow vegetables; to kill Desdemona) seem to be motivating factors in acting. But because these are not considerations in light of which one acts, they do not fall under the category “motivating reasons” as currently understood (but see Audi 1993).

[...]

"When I call a reason “motivating”, all that I am doing is issuing a reminder
that the focus of our attention is on matters of motivation, for the moment.
When I call it “normative”, again all that I am doing is stressing that we are
currently thinking about whether it is a good reason, one that favours acting in
the way proposed" (Dancy 2000: 2–3).

[...]

According to this suggestion, there is a single notion of a reason that is used
to answer different questions: the question whether there is a reason for
someone to do something (normative) and the question what someone’s reason for
acting is (motivating). For instance, we can ask whether there is a reason for
the government of a country to tax sugary drinks (normative), and ask also for
the government’s reason for actually taxing the drinks (motivating).

[...]

The distinction between normative and motivating reasons, therefore, enables us
 to separate the question what reasons motivate agents to act (a psychological
 question) and the question whether those are good reasons: reasons that favour
 and justify their acting thus.

# BAD TAKE BELOW
# This difference between normative reason and motivating reason is perfect.

# I can argue that there is some ambiguity in asking whether plurality rule is justifiable. Because justifiability is a property of acts and or beliefs.

# Which leads to reasons, basis for acting or believing.

# And finally to KINDS of reasons. Motivating or normative.

# From a motivating point of view it is obvious that plurality rule is justifiable, as its one of the most used voting methods (hand wavy). Which specific reasons are evoked by political actors, however, is not something that i'm aware of. It is an interesting empirical question (akin to elster's local justice research program, and with their third line of research https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/verbundprojekte/rtg-collective-decision-making/research/p3.html)
# But i believe this is not the intended meaning of the question. From a pragmatic point of view I believe I have been asked to give an exposition whether there are normative reasons for using/choosing plurality rule.

# OK, my argument is that political agents as matter of fact have reasons that motivate them. So plurality is justifiable as it is amenable to be defended, is empirically justified, as widespread, but this is almost vacuously true.

# The meat of the question is whether plurality rule is justified in a normative sense. Supposing agents were impartial observers of their action situation should they use plurality rule?

# There are many complications. There are reasons for and against and those are conditional on the context.

Two kinds of justification:
#+begin_quote
*Deontological Justification (DJ)*
S is justified in believing that p if and only if S is not obliged to refrain from believing that p.

[...]
Whereas when we evaluate an action, we are interested in assessing the action
from either a moral or a prudential point of view, when it comes to beliefs,
what matters may be something else,[24] e.g., the pursuit of truth, or of
understanding, or of knowledge.

Exactly what, though, must we do in the pursuit of some such distinctively
epistemic aim? According to one answer, the one favored by evidentialists, we
ought to believe in accord with our evidence.

[...]

Other philosophers might deny this evidentialist answer, but still say that the
pursuit of the distinctively epistemic aims entails that we ought to *follow the
correct epistemic norms.*

[...]


*Sufficient Likelihood Justification (SLJ)*
S is justified in believing that p if and only if S believes that p in a way that makes it sufficiently likely that her belief is true.
#+end_quote


#+begin_quote
What makes a belief that p justified, when it is? Whether a belief is justified
or unjustified, there is something that makes it so. According to
“evidentialists”, it is the believer’s *possession of evidence for p*.
Evidentialism is often contrasted with reliabilism, which is the view that a
belief is justified by resulting from a reliable source, where a source is
reliable just in case it tends to result in mostly true beliefs.

[...]

some philosophers claim that what justifies a belief is that it is produced by a process that is reliable
