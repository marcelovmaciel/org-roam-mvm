  Because people have to learn how to play games.
  #+begin_quote
 Instead of constructing utility functions on the basis of single episodes, we
  must do so on the basis of observed runs of behavior once it has stabilized,
  signifying maturity of learning for the subjects in question and the game in
  question.
  #+end_quote

  Socialization and imitation are the mediations through which people learn the rules of the games. The corollary for analysis is :
  #+begin_quote
[...] when observed behavior does not stabilize around equilibria in a game, and  there is no evidence that learning is still in process, the analyst should  infer that she has incorrectly modeled the situation she is studying. Chances are that she has either mis-specified playersâ€™ utility functions, the strategies available to the players, or the information that is available to them. Given the complexity of many of the situations that social scientists study, we should not be surprised that mis-specification of models happens frequently. Applied game theorists must do lots of learning, just like their subjects.
