This is basically an educative paper idea. Here I discuss the origins of social
choice, public choice, and rct. Show the tensions between public choice and
social choice, how rational choice is not a synonym to public choice. Discuss
the influences of the three schools. Here I would need to discuss methodological
individualism and self-interest. Definitely.
